These are my notes taken while watching conferences or videos related to bug bounty hunting and penetration testing.\\
Their purpose is to help me (and others) quickly access information or tips presented in the videos whithout having to watch them again. While on pentest engagements or on a bug bounty hunt, time is of the essence!
