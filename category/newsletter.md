Welcome to The 5 Hacking NewsLetter!

This is where I share with you every week the 5 coolest things related to hacking/pentest/bug bounty that I came accross and enjoyed. These are things that I have read, watched, listened to, used, etc.
I got the idea from Tim Ferris's [5 bullet friday](https://tim.blog/2015/08/07/5-bullet-friday/) email newsletter.

If you prefer receiving each issue in your inbox, I invite you to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/subscribe.html" style="text-decoration:underline">subscribe</a> to this blog. I'll then notify you when any article is out.
