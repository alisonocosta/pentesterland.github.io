twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 27 of December to 03 of January.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Video of the week
> [Finding Your First Bug: Goal Setting / Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BTvTE3gEq8)

This title is voluntarily misleading. The video is not exactly about finding RCEs, rather how to use goal setting and motivation to learn and eventually get your first RCE.

This comes at a perfect time when many hackers (especially bug hunters) are sharing their goals for the new year.

But there is a huge different between a goal expressed as a wish, and measurable and realistic goals accompanied by an actionable plan.

So, this is an absolutely must watch if you want to learn about goal setting (using the S.M.A.R.T. method) applied to bug bounty, how to create an action plan (using the GROW method), non technical skills you need to develop as a hacker, and much more.

If I could like this a hundred times, I would! Thanks @InsiderPhD ♡

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Account takeover via HTTP Request Smuggling](https://hipotermia.pw/bb/http-desync-account-takeover)

This is an excellent walkthrough of a HTTP Request Smuggling attack. It goes beyond detection and shows how to confirm and exploit the vulnerability for account takeover.

This is interesting because simple detection with Burp's Request Smuggler plugin is not enough, as it is prone to false positives.

### 3. Tools of the week
> - [Endpointdiff](https://github.com/ameenmaali/endpointdiff)
> - [Hakrawler](https://github.com/hakluke/hakrawler) & [Introduction](https://medium.com/@hakluke/introducing-hakrawler-a-fast-web-crawler-for-hackers-ff799955f134)

These are two nice additions to a Web app tester's arsenal.

Endpointdiff can help with JavaScript files monitoring. Its uses LinkFinder to retrieve endpoints from JS files and compares the output with the previous results.

Hakrawler is described as a simple, fast web crawler designed for easy, quick discovery of endpoints and assets. It is similar to Photon but written in Go and made for crawling large lists of domains. It also has an option to export the results for chaining with other tools like Sqlmap.

### 4. Resource of the week
> [Lesser-known Tools for Android Application PenTesting](https://captmeelo.com/pentest/2019/12/30/lesser-known-tools-for-android-pentest.html)

Amazing article by @CaptMeelo for anyone interested in testing the security of Android apps.

It's about some tools he finds helpful for assessments. They are useful for:

- Bypassing protections against screenshots
- Byassing Root detection
- Using ADB over Wifi
- A better method for retrieving logs (simplified and colorful output)
- Removing the terminal size limitation when using ADB shell

### 5. Tutorials of the week
> - [Low-Hanging Apples: Hunting Credentials and Secrets in iOS Apps](https://spaceraccoon.dev/low-hanging-apples-hunting-credentials-and-secrets-in-ios-apps)
> - [Password Spraying Dell SonicWALL Virtual Office](https://www.n00py.io/2019/12/password-spraying-dell-sonicwall-virtual-office/)

The first link is a cool tutorial by @spaceraccoonsec on finding credentials and secrets in iOS apps. Methods explained include both static and dynamic analysis.

These are the basics that can help snag heasy bounties or help with traditional penetration testing. Very helpful indeed!

The second tutorial by @n00py1 goes through a situation where using Burp Macros was necessary. The login functionality he was testing used a CSRF token. So, it was not possible to test it with Intruder without setting up a macro and creating a session handling rule. The article shows exactly how to do that.
