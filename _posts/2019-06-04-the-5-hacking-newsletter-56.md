twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 24 to 31 of May.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tool of the week
> [Keye](https://github.com/clirimemini/Keye)

Keye is a really useful recon tool. It's the first one I've come across that allows hackers to easily monitor changes in URLs.

It's written in Python with SQLite3 integrated. You give it a list of urls, and run it periodically (using Cron for example). It then requests the urls and detects changes based on the responses' Content-Length. You can also receive Slack notifications when changes are detected.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Stored XSS via MIME sniffing](https://anotherhackerblog.com/exploiting-file-uploads-pt1/)

This is a great writeup on file upload vulnerabities. The author breaks down how he found a stored XSS through file upload.

I love the way he explains what he did step by step, from detecting which extensions are allowed and which filters are in place, to bypassing them and executing an XSS. A worthy read!

### 3. Slides of the week

> [Building Virtual Machine Labs](https://github.com/da667/Building_Virtual_Machine_Labs-Live_Training)

This is an excellent resource if you want to build a pentest lab.

It's 453 slides detailing everything: which OS/VMs you need to install (including Kali, Metasploitable 2, Firewall with pfSense, SIEM with Splunk...), how to do it, how to automate OS updates, intro to virtualization, which software you need on each OS (Linux, OS X & Windows) and much more.

I wish I had this when I had just started out. Such a time saver!

### 4. Conference of the week

> [Automating the Recon Process by armaan pathan null Ahmedabad Meet 26 May 2019 Monthly Meet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO4RkPiVhhA&feature=youtu.be) & [Slides](https://ravirajput.github.io/recon_by_armaanpathan12345/#/)

Armaan (@armaancrockroax) got [$21,000](https://twitter.com/armaancrockroax/status/1134664934518808576) from bug bounty last month. So when he talks about automation, I'm all ears!

In this talk, he shows how he:
- combines multiple tools to enumerate subdomains
- resolves and sorts subdomains
- finds Jenkins with Shodan
- gets Slack notifications for all scans
- found a Jenkins RCE in Verizon using this same testing methodology

This is a short, sweet and very practical talk. Code snippets are also provided (check out the slides).

### 5. Video of the week

> [Writing a Pentest Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOoBAq6z4Zk) & [Sample report](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report)

This is an awesome resource for junior penetration testers (and students who want to become professional pentesters). It provides a pentest report template and goes through each page and detail to explain the reasoning behind it.

Of course, this is not meant to be copied and used as as... Every company uses custom report templates for a reason: they tend to elvolve mission after mission, following client feedback and any new ideas that you have.\\
But this template is an excellent basis. It contains all the important sections and information you want to convey to clients.
