twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our latest favorite resources related to pentest & bug bounty.

This issue exceptionally covers two weeks, from 13 to 27 of July.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image }}" alt="T5HN13.png" >

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Non technical item of the week

> [Under the Hoodie Videos: True Stories from Rapid7 Pen Testers](https://www.rapid7.com/info/under-the-hoodie/)\\
> [Under the Hoodie - Lessons from a Season of Penetration Testing](https://www.rapid7.com/globalassets/_pdfs/research/rapid7-under-the-hoodie-2018-research-report.pdf)

I absolutely loved watching these videos, especially "The Bank Job"!

Having only conducted technical "classic" penetration testing and never social engineering or red team engagements, I find these tales mind-blowing. It's like watching a good action movie made by real hackers.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [The Daily Swig](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig) by the creators of Burp Suite

If I had to choose only one news site to follow, it would be The Daily Swig.

I added it to my RSS feed and what I like about it most compared to other news sites is that it doesn't flood you with tens of articles everyday about who hacked who, who was arrested, etc.\\
It presents only few IT sec news which are relevant to me as a pentester / bug hunter, in very concise & well written words.

### 3. Tutorial of the week
> [The poor man's bug bounty monitoring setup](https://edoverflow.com/2018/the-poor-mans-monitoring-setup/) by [EdOverflow](https://twitter.com/edoverflow/)

I stumbled upon this blog post just as was researching the best way to automate the process of monitoring bug bounty target assets.
{% capture hunter-1 %}{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-25-bug-bounty-talks-2017-automation-for-bug-hunters %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture hunter-2 %}{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-19-levelup-2018-Trickle-Down-PwnOnomics %}{% endcapture %}
Many successful [bug]({{ hunter-1 }}) [hunters]({{ hunter-2 }}) strongly recommend doing that especially if you are a full time bug hunter, to gain an advantage over hunters who are not monitoring their targets' assets (subdomains, acquisitions, TLDs, new functionalities...).

### 4. Video of the week

> [Bug Hunting as a Second Income](https://www.ethicalhacker.net/eh-net-tv/eh-net-live/video-bug-hunting-as-a-second-income/) & [Slides](https://www.ethicalhacker.net/wp-content/uploads/eh-net_tv/eh-net_live/July2018/EH-Net-Live-July-2018-Bug-Hunting-as-a-Second-Income-with-Jason-Haddix-of-Bugcrowd.pdf)

This webinar is a nice complement to Jason Haddix's [Bug hunters methodology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1nNPiH_Go) talk. It is great for anyone starting in bug bounty or just to learn more about Jason's process.

### 5. Tool of the week
> [cc.py](https://github.com/si9int/cc.py) by [Si9int](https://twitter.com/si9int)

[Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/) is an open repository of web *crawl* data that can be accessed and analyzed by anyone for free.\\
Cc.py extracts URLs of the target you give it from the Common Crawl dataset. It allows you to quickly and **passively** obtain a list of URLs available on your target domain, that have been gathered by Common Crawl.

Needless to say that I've already added it to my arsenal & methodology!
