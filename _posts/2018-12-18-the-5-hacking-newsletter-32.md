twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 07 to 14 of December.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Slides of the week
> [Hidden Gems in APKs](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2018dxb/materials/D1T2%20-%20Gold%20Digging%20-%20Discovering%20Hidden%20Gems%20in%20APKs%20-%20Marc%20Schoenefeld.pdf)

This is a great resource to learn more on testing Android apps. A lot of interesting information can be gathered even if the talk itself isn't available.

The presentation includes three parts:
1. How to analyze an APK and where to find vulnerable code
2. Two cases studies with many examples of vulnerabilities found on real apps, plus other random findings
3. Tools used: [scanapk](https://github.com/MarcSchoenefeld/scanapk), kpa_esrever and kpa_esrever (couldn't find them anywhere)
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [XXE on private program](https://www.honoki.net/2018/12/from-blind-xxe-to-root-level-file-read-access/)

Wow, this is one impressive finding! I think that most hunters would have stopped testing this vulnerable endpoint after it returned a 404 error. But not @honoki.

He changed the HTTP method from GET to a POST and the Content-Type to application/xml (instead of text/xml). Seeing that the server responded differently, he started submitting different kinds of XML POST data and analyzing the responses until he got a blind XXE that he elevated to a root-level file read access.

All this with no documentation whatsoever on the endpoint and from a 404 page. Again, impressive!

### 3. Challenge & Tutorial of the week
> [XSS challenge](https://brutelogic.com.br/tests/jsfix.php?keyword=xss) & [Advanced JavaScript Injections](https://brutelogic.com.br/blog/advanced-javascript-injections/) (solution)

If you've ever wondered how complex XSS payloads are constructed, this challenge & tutorial are exactly what you need!

Start with the challenge then, if you couldn't solve it, carefully read the tutorial. It breaks down how to detect the bug and construct a working payload step by step.

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [Darknet Diaries Ep 28: Unit 8200](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/28/)

This is the tale of Israel Unit 8200, Israel's equivalent of the NSA. No matter on which side you stand regarding the Palestine/Israel conflict, this is an amazingly entertaining and insightful story.

It explains why a relatively small country such as Israel is so good at cybersecurity, why so many successful startups emerge there, and why mandatory military service can be a good thing for both individuals and the country (if done right).

Also, the narrator is so talented. This particular episode is a must watch.

### 5. Resource of the week
> [APIsecurity.io  Issue 10: Unprotected Docker and Ethereum APIs, McAfee 2019 forecast](https://apisecurity.io/issue-10-unprotected-docker-ethereum-apis-mcaffee-2019-forecast/)

Apisecurity.io is one of the rare newsletters I follow regularly. It's a weekly publication focused on news related to API security.

I highly recommend it whether you are a pentester, bug hunter or developer interested in security.
