twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! Once again, we scoured the Web to bring you the latest best resources related to pentest & bug bounty.

This issue covers the week from 27 to 03 of July.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tip of the week
> [Finding domains belonging to a specific target](https://www.freelists.org/post/bugbounty/Finding-domains-belonging-to-a-specific-target) by @edoverflow

One of the most important steps during recon is finding domains that belong to your target.

Many talks and tweets tackle the question of subdomains enumeration, but there is a lot less information out there about finding domains. So it's nice to read these practical tips from a confirmed bug hunter.

### 2. Site of the week

> [Eternal Noobs](https://eternalnoobs.com/forums/): Forum for IT security noobs
> - [Where to start](https://eternalnoobs.com/forums/topic/where-to-start/) thread

This is a new forum so there aren't that many discussion threads yet, but the moderators are very reactive, and noob questions are welcome. So this seems to be the right place if you have any bug bounty or pentest questions and don't know who to ask.

A couple of [Web](https://eternalnoobs.com/forums/topic/bypass-login-challenge/) [challenges](https://eternalnoobs.com/forums/topic/xss-in-css-a-little-xss-challenge/) have also been submitted by @brutelogic.

### 3. Video / Tool of the week
> [Haxcellent Adventures [Arsenal] - WPForce by @n00py1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRqUjf1ip3s&feature=youtu.be)

As you can see in the Tools section of this newsletter, there are so many tools released every week! Some are innovative and efficient, others not so much. It is difficult to assess them without trying them, and as I lack time to perform a review of the dozen of tools that seems interesting to me each week, I prefer simply shared them with you so that you can have the information and make your own mind.

{% capture challenge-url %}{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-27-vulnhub-Bsides-Vancouver-2018-walkthrough %}{% endcapture %}
For these reasons, I love this new series by @sneakerhax where he tries a tool and gives his opinion on whether it is worth adding to his hacking arsenal or not. The tool in this first video is WPForce. I've already played with it while doing a [challenge]({{ challenge-url }}) and confirm that it is very fast and effective.

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [ZTH-CH2: - Security For Everyone](https://blog.zsec.uk/zth-ch2/) by @ZephrFish

This article presents basic  common sense advice to secure yourself online. It's nothing new but a nice refresher, and could also serve as a tutorial to which you could refer friends, family or anyone that need easy practical tips to improve their online security.

### 5. Writeup of the week
> [Hacking IoT Cameras with s/swnb479e7d24/swn1bf9f32f2/g](https://scotthelme.co.uk/hacking-iot-cameras/)\\
> [Hacking Swann & FLIR/Lorex home security camera video](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/hacking-swann-home-security-camera-video/)

This is a great real-life example of how to exploit IoT devices. The attacks are not technically complicated and there isn't any mention of a bounty, but I think it is fascinating and scary to see how easy it is to hack these cameras. A simple IDOR to access the video feed of any other camera that's online!
