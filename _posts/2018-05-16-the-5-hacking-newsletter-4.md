twitter-description: Weekly favorites, curated with love by and for hackers!
---

Hi, I'm very happy to present you this week's five items! After a few weeks break due to rich personal circumstances, it is time to resume our weekly shenanigangs...

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image }}" alt="T5HN4.png" >

## 1. Collection of hacker conferences
> <https://infocon.org/>

This site is a "Hacking conference archive". It gathers presentation videos and slides from a lot of conferences, documentaries, podcasts and also rainbow tables.
I love going through it to discover new conferences and talks from around the world!

## 2. Bug bounty reports Github repository
> <https://github.com/gwen001/bb-reports-templates> by [Gwendal Le Coguic](https://twitter.com/gwendallecoguic)

Creating bug bounty reports templates is a great idea! It helps report bugs quickly and easily. This repository is a very nice starting point.

## 3. Tools of the week
> [Domain analyzer](https://github.com/eldraco/domain_analyzer)
> [Amass](https://github.com/caffix/amass)

I like using different subdomain finder tools and merging their findings for maximum results. These two tools are very effective and can be nice additions to your arsenal too.

## 4. Bug bounty write-up of the week
> [How I used a simple Google query to mine passwords from dozens of public Trello boards](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/discovering-the-hidden-mine-of-credentials-and-sensitive-information-8e5ccfef2724) by Kushagra Pathak

This is a good writeup on how simple Google queries can reveals very sensitive information stored on Trello boards.
I am adding these tests to my penetration testing & bug bounty hunting checklists.

## 5. Trending twitter hashtags
> [#bugbountytip](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bugbountytip?src=hash)\\
> [#bugbountytips](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bugbountytips)\\
> [#togetherwehiharder](https://twitter.com/hashtag/togetherwehitharder?src=hash)\\

> [#XBugBountyTips](https://twitter.com/hashtag/XBugBountyTips?src=hash)\\
