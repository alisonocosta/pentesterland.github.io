twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 11 to 18 of October.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Video of the week
> [Lets be a dork and read .js files with zseano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jM8dDVifaI)

JavaScript analysis is a very important step when testing the security of a website. If, like me, you never were a programmer and struggle with this, then this video is a must!

@zseano walks us through what to look for in them and how, plus an introduction to Google and Github dorks.
<!--more-->

### 2. Resource of the week
> [XXE Cheat Sheet - SecurityIdiots](https://securityidiots.com/Web-Pentest/XXE/XXE-Cheat-Sheet-by-SecurityIdiots.html)

This is a nice cheetsheet to help with XXE detection, exploitation and Out-Of-Band exploitation, and WAF bypass. A good reference!

### 3. Article of the week
> [A Tale of Exploitation in Spreadsheet File Conversions](https://buer.haus/2019/10/18/a-tale-of-exploitation-in-spreadsheet-file-conversions/)

Do you remember this awesome [video snippet](https://twitter.com/daeken/status/1185307251277467648) with @daeken where he was clapping because obviously some kind of exploit or bug worked? It turns out that he was working on a Ghostscript payload in LibreOffice, in collaboration with @bbuerhaus, @smiegles, and @erbbysam.

It did work, and this is the writeup of the whole research that led to that bug. It touches on many topics: Ghostscript, fingerprinting LibreOffice, LFD, SSRF... This is worth reading and a great example of research in Web app security.

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [A well curated 60s playlist for those slow Saturday mornings](https://twitter.com/stokfredrik/status/1182938497398784000)

This is a really cool playlist. 100% Stök, only happy vibes.
I've been listening only to Deep House & Electro mixes (from Kygo, Dj Drop G...), so this is a refreshing change. 

### 5. Tool of the week
> [CSP](https://github.com/EdOverflow/csp)

Retrieving a list of whitelisted hosts from CSP headers is not a new recon technique. But the novelty with this tool from @EdOverflow is that it automates the process.

You can get a list of hosts with a one-liner, and feed it to your other tools.
