twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 12 to 19 of July.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tutorial of the week

> [Using Wireshark over SSH (WS on Windows traffic on Linux)](https://pastebin.com/pCrBvRX3)

This is a short how-to for using Wireshark over SSH. It'll be really handy if your main host is Windows, and you are using a Linux VPS for tests.

The steps described will allow you to run Wireshark locally, and use it to analyze traffic captured on the remote Linux server (even if you don't have a GUI on the latter!).

### 2. Writeup of the week

> [Cracking my windshield and earning $10,000 on the Tesla Bug Bounty Program](https://samcurry.net/cracking-my-windshield-and-earning-10000-on-the-tesla-bug-bounty-program/) ($10,000)

What a fun bug! @samwcyo bought a Tesla, tried to hack it, didn't find anything, cracked his windshield, then accidentally triggered a blind XSS when he wanted to report the accident.

My takeaways are:
- Put blind XSS payloads everywhere
- [Own](https://twitter.com/zseano/status/1150496100933079040) a Tesla one day
- Then [damage it intentionally](https://twitter.com/_bl4de/status/1151101822263803905) to find new bugs

### 3. Video of the week

> [Understanding & bypassing filters with @zseano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtFlbUUKL1Y)

@zseano walks us through why all XSSes are not low hanging fruits, and how he proceeds to find edge cases by bypassing filters.

If you want to stop trying random payloads grabbed from the Internet and learn how to manually find interesting XSSes like a pro, this is the video to watch!

Also, it's a good idea to focus on one bug at a time. That's what @zseano and @nahamsec did and recommend.

### 4. Conference of the week

> [SteelCon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmfJypsykTLXk1QHj6PqiD7q7Z-WEj31U), especially:
>  - [SteelCon 2019: Hunting Sh\*T Up: Red Teaming With A Bug Hunter's Mindset - Andy Gill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhiQRkTkzk&feature=youtu.be)
>  - [TLS 1.3 For Penetration Testers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PP4v6jesAQ&list=PLmfJypsykTLXk1QHj6PqiD7q7Z-WEj31U&index=9&t=0s)
>  - [WordPress Isn't A Security Dumpster Fire, Fight Me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzy3UYXfIXQ&list=PLmfJypsykTLXk1QHj6PqiD7q7Z-WEj31U&index=20&t=0s)

These talks go to my top list of things to watch really soon. Especially  the one by Andy Gill because it's about three aspects of offensive security in which I'm very interested: Pentesting, Bug bounty and Red teaming.
Applying a bug hunter's mindset to pentest and red teaming can only be a good idea: bug hunting pushes you to automate as much as you can, go for the most impactful bugs and PoCs, work fast by using report templates, use/create the best tools... But many tools used for Web security today were created by bug hunters and aren't known by many pentesters.

So I can't wait to learn Andy's take on this subject, and learn about TLS 1.3 and Wordpress security.

### 5. Article of the week

> [Web Application Penetration Testing: Minimum Checklist Based on the OWASP Testing Guide](https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/622-qa-web-application-pen-testing-owasp-checklist)

This article is aimed at QA specialists. But I think it's also a good read for beginner pentesters who don't have the time to go trough the whole OWASP Testing Guide and need a quick summary.

Not that I don't encourage reading the whole thing (on the contrary!). But it can be overwhelming when you're just starting out.

The cheatsheet is useful to use during tests or as a basis for your own customized cheatsheet. I love how each test is accompanied with a concise comment that's like the most important thing that you need to know about that test.
