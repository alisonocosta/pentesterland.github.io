twitter-description: Weekly favorites, curated with love by and for hackers!
---

Hey, hackers!\\
OMG, this week there were even more interesting things published & shared accross Youtube, Twitter, Medium, blogs, etc, than last time!\\
It was just impossible to choose only 5 items, and this is becoming a habit. So we're trying a new format: Our 5 favorite items (just a matter of personal preference) commented, followed by all the other fantastic findings in the form of a list of links.

Let me know if you prefer this format or the older one, and if you have any suggestions or comments. It's always a pleasure to hear from you!

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Writeup of the week
- [How i was able to get admin panel on a private program ](http://cybristerboy.blogspot.com/2018/05/how-i-was-able-to-get-admin-panel-on.html)

I love the simplicity yet effectiveness of this technique. It was rewarded $1,500 and shows (yet again) the importance of recon, particularly retrieving and analyzing certificates from censys.io.
<!--more-->

### 2. Non technical video of the week
> [Infosec Resume No-Nos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOA3-vP1JLw&feature=youtu.be&a=) by [Lesley Carhart](https://tisiphone.net/category/ask-lesley/)

This is a short video that offers great advice for anyone in the infosec / cybersecurity field working on their resume. It reviews the most common errors people make.\\
It might be helpful if you're looking for a job!

### 3. Tip / Tweet of the week
> [`Tip to access a 403 forbidden page: instead of going straight to the file for example :index.html Add a / behind the index.html: index.html/. Worked multiple times for me`](https://twitter.com/quintenvi/status/1001889053975904256)\\
> By [Van Ingh Quinten](https://twitter.com/quintenvi)

Nice trick to bypass 403 Forbidden page errors. Already added to my testing checklist!

### 4. Tutorial of the week
> [Blind XSS for beginners](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/blind-xss-for-beginners-c88e48083071)

This is a great introduction to blind XSS. It sums up everything you need to know to start looking for this type of vulnerability.

### 5. Must watch conference
> [LevelUp 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIK9nm3mu-S6gCKmlC5CDFhWvbEX9fNW6) by [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/)

Does it need any introduction? I'm sure you did not need me to inform you of this conference, but I couldn't not mention here. I've been waiting for it for months and it did not disappoint.

High quality talks, a lot of tips, pentest and bug bounty techniques mentioned, the latest "Bug bounty hunter methodology" by Jason Haddix, etc. A must watch!
