twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 09 of November to 16 of November.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [DEF CON 26 Recon Village](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH), particularly:\\
>	- [Emergent Recon fresh methodology and tools for hackers in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j6MNApbYtE&index=25&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH)\\
>	- [Bug Bounty Hunting on Steroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WYjSDZxFYc&index=21&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH)\\
>	- [Supercharge Your Web Recon With Commonspeak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxkuBFUfnL8&index=16&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH)\\
>	- [Building Visualisation Platforms for OSINT Data Using OSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r-1Z3yQVa4&index=2&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH)\\
>	- [Skiptracer Ghetto OSINT for Broke Hackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mEOkwrxfsU&index=3&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH)\\
>	- [Introducing YOGA Your OSINT Graphical Analyzer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApB1FibIquE&index=4&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH)

I wasn't sure if the DEF CON Recon village talks were going to be made public. Boy, was I happy to see them shared on Youtube!

I was rooting especially for:
- Jason Haddix's latest methodology & tools for recon (but slides are missing)
- More information on how BountyMachine works. Sadly it won't be open sourced :/

All the talks are interesting since they focus on recon in a very practical way.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [XSS in hidden input fields](https://portswigger.net/blog/xss-in-hidden-input-fields) & [PoC](http://portswigger-labs.net/link/)

When XSS payload is injected inside a hidden input field, it can be hard to exploit. Until now, one way to do it was using expression() but it worked only on IE<=9.

This writeup shows a new technique to exploit such XSS bugs on Firefox and Chrome:\\
`<input type="hidden" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)">` (Firefox)\\
`<link rel="canonical" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)" />` (Chrome)

The payload is executed once the victim presses the key combination ALT+SHIFT+X (on Windows & Linux) or CTRL+ALT+X (on Mac OS X).

### 3. Tool of the week
> [Universal Android SSL Pinning Bypass #2](https://techblog.mediaservice.net/2018/11/universal-android-ssl-pinning-bypass-2/)

This is a very impressive script. It allows you to bypass all SSL certificate checks on any Android app, including SSL pinning.

Playing with Android apps' source code and different SSL pinning bypass techniques can be fun and educational. But sometimes, we're on a hurry and just want to get rid of SSL pining to start looking for bugs. It's never been this easy!

All you have to do is install Frida, download the script and run it on the app's package name.\\
It's almost instantaneous and you don't have to meddle with the app's code, re-patch it, etc.

### 4. Tip of the week
> [New technique to find Blind-XSS](https://medium.com/@renwa/new-technique-to-find-blind-xss-c2efcd377cc2)

This is a great tip for finding less obvious blind XSS vulnerabilities: Don't limit yourself to testing forms. **Find contact email addresses** (by scraping your target site or guessing), and **send your payload to them** (in subject & body).

Sometimes the forms are well sanitized but the email messages are not and they're added to the same admin portals.

### 5. Non technical item of the week
> [Singing the Blues: Taking Down an Insider Threat](https://threader.app/thread/1063423110513418240)

This is a great account of what went wrong during a pentest... for the pentester, because the target was doing their job well!

I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say that it reminds me of the [Stealing the network](https://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Network-Complete-Collectors-Chapter/dp/159749299X) books. It's both a (little bit) technical & a very entertaining read.
