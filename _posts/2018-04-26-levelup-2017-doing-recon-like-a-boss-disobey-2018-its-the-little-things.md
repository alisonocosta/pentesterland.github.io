twitter-description: Notes taken while watching interesting hacking conferences & videos
---

Hi, these are the notes I took while watching the "Doing recon like a boss" talk given by Ben Sadeghipour on LevelUp 2017.

[UPDATE] I modified these notes after watching the updated version of this talk: "It's the little things" by Ben Sadeghipour & Jon Bottarini (Disobey 2018).

## Overview
- Why: Bigger attack surface, more bugs, more bounties, more problems

## Traditional way for finding subdomains (brute forcing)
- Brute force
	- Sublist3r
<!--more-->
	- enumall
	- massdns
	- altdns
	- brutesubs
	- dns-parallel-prober
	- dnscan
	- knockpy
	- tko-subs
	- HostileSubBruteforce
- Find patterns (.dev, .corp, .stage)
- Brute force again: Subdomain brute-force patterns dicovered to find:
	- Different permutations
	- Different environment (like staging environments)
- Google Dork: `site.com -www -cdn`

## AWS recon
- Look for S3 buckets
	- `site:s3.amazonaws.com + ...` (for e.g `site:s3.amazonaws.com + inurl:HackerOne`)
	- You might find an internal domain that is not accessible directly but if you go to the Amazon Web Services they are
- AWS instances
	- `site:amazonaws.com -s3`
	- `site:amazonsaws.com inurl:bugcrowd`
- Use Google for patterns
- Github
	- Search example: `"amazonaws.com" trello`
- Automate your work
	- Create a list of subdomains
	- Create a list of environment: Prod, Stage, Dev
	- Automate with tools like:
		- [bucket_finder](https://digi.ninja/projects/bucket_finder.php) now integrated with [CloudStorageFinder](https://github.com/digininja/CloudStorageFinder) by diji.ninja
		- [SandCastle](https://ysx.me.uk/sandcastle/) by YasinS
		- [Lazys3](https://github.com/nahamsec/lazys3) by Ben Sadeghipour & Jobert Abma (I'm not sure this is the tool mentioned in the video, but it was created by the presenter)
- What could go wrong?
	- S3 bucket not owned by company (despite its name sounding like it does)
	- Going out of scope
		- Domain on which you have read/write access but it was taken out of scope
	- S3 bucket that has directory listing enabed but doesn't contain any sensitive info, or just has static assets
	- Third party apps & third party developers

## Github recon
- What you can find:
	- Environments (dev, stage, prod)
	- Secret Keys (API_key, AWS_Secret, LDAP, FTP...)
	- Internal credentials
	- API endpoints
	- Domain patterns (internal or external)
- Search examples:
	- `"company.com" "dev"`
	- `"dev.company.com"`
	- `"dev.company.com" password/api_key`
	- `"company.com" API_key`
	- `"company.com" password`
	- `"api.company.com"`
- Google Dork: `site:"Github.com" + "ORG" + ...`
- Tools
	- gitrob
	- git-all-secrets
	- truffleHog
	- git-secrets	
	- repo-supervisor	
	- You can find more things by doing it manually
- What could go wrong?
	- Logging in to the app with too many accounts or with the CTO account can upset the company
	- Finding credentials of an employee that no longer works at the company but still has some limited access
	- Old secret_keys
		- Always test secret keys you find before reporting to make sure they're valid
	- The S3 bucket doesn't contain any sensitive info
	- Third party apps
	- Example / Demo creds / Fake info / 3rd party contractors
	- Random people trying to build something by using the target's API's

## Asset identification
### Search engines
Get creative!

- censys.io
	- Look for SSL certificates
		- `443.https.tls.certificate.parsed.extensions.subject_alt_name.dns_name:bugcrowd.com`
	- Look for Internal certificates
		- `"COMPANY" + internal (get creative)`\\
		=> might allow you to find a company internal subdomain or IP address not mentioned anywhere
- shodan.io
	- Search by hostname
	- Filter for:
		- `Ports: 8443, 8080, 8180, 15672, etc`
		- `Title: "Dashboard [Jenkins]"`
		- `Product: Tomcat`
		- `Hostname: corp.levelup.com`
		- `Org: Bugcrowd`
	- Search queries to do:
		- `Org: Bugcrowd [option]`
		- `hostname: company.com [option]`
		Where [option] is one of the options above (filter on ports, title or product)
	- Buy book [Complete Guide to Shodan](https://leanpub.com/shodan) by Shodan creator for only 4.99$
- Certspotter
	- Great API
	- Easy to automate
	- Find corporate certs, servers, other litle things that orgs think you'll never find like internal IP addresses...

### JavaScript files
- What you can find:
	- URL endpoints
	- Credentials/tokens
	- More (internal) subdomains
	- Secret internal API's
	- Sensitive comments
- Where to find JS files?
	- Go to the website
	- archive.org & look for old JS files
- Tools:
	- [JS Parser](https://github.com/nahamsec/JSParser)

### archive.org
- Search for your target
- Select a date
- Review the source
 Find old endpoints/functionality
- Look for JS files
- Exploit them!
