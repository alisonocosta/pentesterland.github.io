twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 10 to 17 of January.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Webinar of the week
> [SEC642: Killing snakes for fun, Flask SSTIs and RCEs in Python](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/sec642-killing-snakes-fun-flask-sstis-rces-python-112860) (Free registration required)

This is an excellent course on SSTIs with a focus on Python frameworks.

I love that it does not only explain how SSTIs work and how to escalate them to RCE, but it also mentions a lot of background information to understand the big picture: Why Python frameworks were created, how they work, the history of Python and Flask, etc.
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Advisory \| Seagate Central Storage Remote Code Execution 0day](https://pentest.blog/advisory-seagate-central-storage-remote-code-execution/)

This is a nice example of RCE found using security code review with a bottom-up approach. It also shows how to reverse and analyze the firmware of a NAS.

Both RCE and code review can be intimidating. But the way everything is broken in this writeup makes them seem easy to follow even for beginners. 

### 3. Challenge of the week
> [SKF labs](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs)

There is a plethora of XSS challenges but labs for GraphQL bugs, JWT, SSRF, SSTI, lack of rate limiting, etc, are rarer. So, these labs are perfect if you want to play with these vulnerabilities and many others.
The best part is that detailed walkthroughs are provided for each bug.

### 4. Video of the week
> [Finding Your First Bug: Finding Bugs Using APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCUQBc2rY9Y)

As always, a great tutorial video by @InsiderPhD! I think this is the best introduction to APIs I've ever seen. It covers everything you need to start exploiting them ASAP: What APIs are, how to find and enumerate them, types of APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL), what is JSON, what bugs to look for, how to take notes, etc.

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [Intruder and CSRF-protected form, without macros](https://www.agarri.fr/blog/archives/2020/01/13/intruder_and_csrf-protected_form_without_macros/index.html)

Did you know that macros are not the only way to deal with CSRF tokens in Burp?

@Agarri_FR shows in great detail how to use Intruder Pitchfork to mimick manually replacing the CSRF token with the latest value sent by the server, and the advantages over macros.
