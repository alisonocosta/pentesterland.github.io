Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources related to pentesting and bug hunters that we came across recently.

This issue covers the week from 14 to 21 of September.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

It's weird how often I face a new challenge and, while preparing this newsletter, come across relevant resources without looking for them specifically! This is the case for all 5 items of this week, so I hope that you find them as informative as they were for me.

### 1. Tutorial of the week
> [Discovering GraphQL endpoints and SQLi vulnerabilities](https://medium.com/@localh0t/discovering-graphql-endpoints-and-sqli-vulnerabilities-5d39f26cea2e) by @localh0t

I read more and more bug bounty writeups like [this one](https://hackerone.com/reports/397130) or [this one](https://sites.google.com/securifyinc.com/secblogs/shopify-athena-bug) that mention misconfigured GraphQL endpoints and these bugs seem to pay really well.

GraphQL is an alternative to Web services like REST. This tutorial is a great introduction to understand their differences, how to find hidden GraphQL endpoints and exploit them to detect SQL injection.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [How I XSS‚Äôed Uber and Bypassed CSP](https://medium.com/@efkan162/how-i-xssed-uber-and-bypassed-csp-9ae52404f4c5) by @mefkansec

I love the creativity of the recon work that led to this XSS: @mefkansec looked for Uber invitation links mentioned everywhere on forums & social media. Then he used a google dork to find a lot more invitation links in order to gather new GET parameters until he found one that was vunerable to a simple reflective XSS.

But the PoC didn't work because of the CSP! The list of whitelisted domains showed that Uber subdomains are allowed. So in his working PoC, he used an Uber subdomain (found in VirusTotal) which redirects to a Marketo subdomain. By adding a callback parameter, he could execute Javascript:

`https://partners.uber.com/p3/referrals/ms?i=bq6ew1w9ue&m=ANNIVERSARY&v=1"><script src=‚Äùhttps://mkto.uber.com/index.php/form/getKnownLead?callback=alert(document.domain);"></script>`

### 3. Tip of the week
> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/9XO0dm2z1b">https://t.co/9XO0dm2z1b</a></p>&mdash; Yassine Aboukir (@Yassineaboukir) <a href="https://twitter.com/Yassineaboukir/status/1043681731453292544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2018</a></blockquote>
> [How to get source code of any electron application](https://medium.com/how-to-electron/how-to-get-source-code-of-any-electron-application-cbb5c7726c37)

@Yassineaboukir recommends reverse engineering and analyzing the source code of Electron apps, as an easy way to find hardcoded secrets. The tutorial he mentions is very concise and should help you get started quickly.

Also, @0xibram recommends in the comments using this guide once you have the source code: [Electron Security Checklist - A guide for developers and auditors](https://doyensec.com/resources/us-17-Carettoni-Electronegativity-A-Study-Of-Electron-Security-wp.pdf).

### 4. Resources of the week
> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally learnt how to bypass CloudFlare üëçLet&#39;s go for some sqli&amp;xss testing. Resources:<a href="https://t.co/D4yp7B3hPC">https://t.co/D4yp7B3hPC</a><a href="https://t.co/sDX2C5jsjd">https://t.co/sDX2C5jsjd</a><a href="https://t.co/VfLlOyIHV9">https://t.co/VfLlOyIHV9</a><a href="https://t.co/XRMfB029nQ">https://t.co/XRMfB029nQ</a></p>&mdash; Gwendal Le Coguic (@gwendallecoguic) <a href="https://twitter.com/gwendallecoguic/status/1043484797799223297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2018</a></blockquote>

@gwendallecoguic suggests 4 blog posts that helped him learn how to bypass Cloudflare. Try the different techniques until you find one that works on your target.

### 5. Tool of the week
> [ct-exposer](https://github.com/chris408/ct-exposer)

This tool helps monitor Certificate Transparency logs for new subdomains, when you're targeting a specific bug bounty program or during a long term pentest engagement.

It uses the API of Entrust Datacard's [Certificate Transparency Search Tool](https://www.entrust.com/ct-search/?_ga=2.244531276.836191926.1537894500-201221832.1537894500).
