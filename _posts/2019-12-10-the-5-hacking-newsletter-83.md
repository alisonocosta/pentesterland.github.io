twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 29 of November to 06 of December.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tutorial of the week
> [Exploiting XSS with 20 characters limitation](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/posts/2019/11/30/XSS_20_characters.html)

This tutorial solves a specific problem: bypassing character limitation to exploit XSS. To do that, the idea is to load a remote JavaScript file hosted on a very short domain.

What I love about this tutorial is that it goes further than theory: in practice most short domains are taken or very expensive. Using Unicode, it is possible to redirect to domains like ℡㏛.pw (5 characters) which expands to telsr.pw (8 characters).
[Two](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2121) [excellent](https://www.unicode.org/charts/normalization/) resources for working with Unicode are also shared.

### 2. Writeups of the week
> - [Account takeover via leaked session cookie on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/745324) ($20,000)
> - [HTTP Request Smuggling + IDOR](https://hipotermia.pw/bb/http-desync-idor)

These writeups are both worth reading for different reasons. The HackerOne account takeover was the most shared/debated this week. @haxta4ok reported a [false positive](https://twitter.com/jobertabma/status/1201992338005848064), but the triager's response included their valid session cookie. $20,000 for human error (and an initial false positive)! HackerOne have added [mitigations](https://twitter.com/jobertabma/status/1201980104013836288) to prevent this happening again, but it could happen to employees that don't use HackerOne's triage or triagers from other companies.

The second writeup shows how you can chain HTTP Request Smuggling with IDOR for increased impact.

### 3. Resource of the week
> [One-time Mobile ☎️ Numbers Thread](https://twitter.com/OsintStash/status/1199785692274077696)

This is a collection of websites for receiving SMS online for free. I haven't had the occasion to test them yet, but I'm bookmarking this for future pentest engagements and bug bounty. They will be handy for SMS verification and 2FA.

### 4. Conference of the week
> [Wild West Hackin' fest (WWHF) 2019](https://www.wildwesthackinfest.com/wwhf-2019-recorded-talks-media/)

This looks like a fun conference to attend. Topics range from Burp Suite collaboration to hacking your career, Google Calendar attack surface, social engineering, building an escape room, Kerberos, etc. There is probably something that woud interest you whether you're into pentest, red team, bug bounty, physical security, social engineering or incident response.

### 5. Article of the week
> [Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and AWS EC2 instances after Instance Meta Data Service version 2(IMDSv2)](https://blog.appsecco.com/server-side-request-forgery-ssrf-and-aws-ec2-instances-after-instance-meta-data-service-version-38fc1ba1a28a)

Following the Capital One breach, AWS EC2 recently introduced new changes to the way metadata information is retrieved. This prevents SSRF exloitation and may leave you wondering whether you should stop looking for SSRF on EC2.

This article is a nice summary of the new changes and what they mean for hackers/bug hunters.
