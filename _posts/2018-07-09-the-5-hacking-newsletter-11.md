twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! Here are our favorite resources for penetration testers and bug bounty hunters for last week (June 29 to July 6).

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Podcast of the week
> [Web Hacking Pro Tips #16 with Bull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh-SxiDR4AQ&feature=youtu.be&a=) by [Peter Yaworski](https://twitter.com/yaworsk)

I loved watching this podcast! The story of [Bull (@v0sx9b)](https://twitter.com/v0sx9b) is impressive: he's a self-taught full-time bug bounty hunter since only 2016 and already making a lot of money. So it's good to listen to his hunting philosophy and tips.

For example, he focuses on big bugs and doesn't report small ones, but rather keeps them to chain them and report higher impact bugs. This way, he reports 6/7 bugs a month on average but with high criticality & reward.

### 2. Tool of the week
> [h1-search](https://github.com/dsopas/h1-search) by [David Sopas](https://www.davidsopas.com/)

This is a handy tool for bug hunters. It'll allow you to quickly grab all publicly disclosed reports of any HackerOne program you are working on.

### 3. Writeup of the week
> [The $12,000 Intersection between Clickjacking, XSS, and Denial of Service](https://samcurry.net/the-12000-intersection-between-clickjacking-xss-and-denial-of-service/) by [Sam Curry](https://twitter.com/samwcy)

This is a great write-up on how to find high reward bugs on a target that has been tested by hundreds or thousands of other researchers. The tricks mentioned include:
- How to bypass an open redirect filter using the *//external.site* trick
- Why you should try both external & internal links when testing for open redirection
- How to cause client Denial of Service with *%0t*
- How to create awesome XSS PoCs using clickjacking and highlighting the information that can be stolen (web sockets session stored within the browser's local storage)

### 4. Tip of the week
> [Free Lists - Bug Bounty](https://www.freelists.org/list/bugbounty)

This is a new mailing list started by [EdOverflow](https://twitter.com/edoverflow). You can browse the [archive](https://www.freelists.org/archive/bugbounty/) and read many good tips for bug hunters like how to [escalate stored XSS for a better reward](https://www.freelists.org/post/bugbounty/Bug-bounty-tip-How-to-escalate-stored-XSS-reports), great [subdomain](https://www.freelists.org/post/bugbounty/Bug-bounty-tip-Find-subdomain-takeovers-via-the-Content-Security-Policy-header) [takeover tricks](https://www.freelists.org/post/bugbounty/Bug-bounty-tip-The-www-subdomain-takeover-trick), etc.

### 5. Non technical item of the week
> <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletters/T5HN11-kiwicon.jpg" alt="T5HN11-kiwicon.jpg" >
> [A Brief History Of Kiwicon Visual Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bStAIITGFB5PMstlqABvUBoiC0_sAszKtWl0mt4HKv8/edit)

Both the contents and the design of this poster are great. It sums up all the excuses I heard from clients as an internal security auditor then pentester. 

The first time I saw it, it made me laugh and feel comforted because I felt less alone in this fight against the false obstacles and excuses.
