twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 20 to 27 of September.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Slide/Tool of the week
> [Manual JavaScript Anaylsis Is A Bug](https://www.slideshare.net/LewisArdern/manual-javascript-anaylsis-is-a-bug-176308491) & [MetaSec.js](https://github.com/LewisArdern/metasecjs)

I hope this talk's video will be released soon. But even without it, this presentation is very helpful in understanding what to look for in JavaScript files, existing tools for automation, and what can/cannot be automated.

Techniques mentioned include endpoint discovery, reversing source maps, technology fingerprinting, detecting sources and sinks, detecting ReDoS, detecting secrets, detecting vulnerable third-party components, etc.

As a bonus, LewisArdern provides MetaSec.js, a wrapper around several open source tools to automate JS file analysis.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Fuzzing \{\{7\*7\}\} Till \{\{P1\}\}](http://verneet.com/fuzzing-77-till-p1/)

This is an SSTI writeup. Detection was pretty straightforward: @err0rrrrr injected \{\{7\*7\}\}\{\{7\*7\}\} as a comment and received an email notification containing `4949`.

The interesting part is that exploitation was hindered by some kind of blacklisting. He could bypass it by bruteforcing local variable names using this custom [wordlist](https://github.com/err0rr/SSTI/blob/master/Wordlist). That's worth adding to Burp to help with stubborn SSTIs!

### 3. Article of the week
> [Application Enumeration Tips using Aquatone and Burp Suite](https://www.ryanwendel.com/2019/09/27/application-enumeration-tips-using-aquatone-and-burp-suite/)

This is an excellent article on automation using Burp and Aquatone.

The novel idea is to use visual identification, not for checking subdomains, but when you're testing a large Web app. When you're limited on time as a pentester, you want to quickly assess a lot of URLs to cover the maximum surface.

@ryanwendel explains how he gets a list of URLs from Burp's proxy history, and passes them to Aquatone to take screenshots. If authentication is required, he makes Aquatone use Burp as a proxy, and leverages Session Handling rules to maintain an authenticated state. So handy!

### 4. Resource of the week
> [One XSS cheatsheet to rule them all](https://portswigger.net/research/one-xss-cheatsheet-to-rule-them-all)

This is the most comprehensive XSS cheatsheet I've seen.

What is also unique about it, apart from the number of payloads, is that it is interactive. You can filter payloads by tag, event handler and browser.

It also features entirely new XSS payloads that @garethheyes found and presented at Global AppSec 2019. The talk wasn't recorded but the slides are available: [XSS Magic tricks](https://www.slideshare.net/GarethHeyes/xss-magic-tricks).

All this should be really helpful with HTML filter and WAF bypass.

### 5. Video of the week
> [09/15/2019 - Live Bug Bounty Recon Session on Yahoo (Censys, Crtsh, Sublist3r) w/ @Yaworsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lUQNwg3K6o&t=1h54m00s)

If you're a fan of @Yaworsk, his books "Real-World Bug Hunting: A Field Guide to Web Hacking" and Web Hacking 101, or his Youtube channel, then you will love this video!

For, once he is the interviewee not the interviewer. The discussion starts at 1h55m00s and covers many topics: Peter's way of doing recon, his testing methodology, his areas of improvements, how he does JS analysis, why he doesn't set Burp scope to only the target app, burnout and way more.
