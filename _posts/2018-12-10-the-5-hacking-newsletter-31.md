twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 30 of November to 07 of December.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [BSides Lisbon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbuNP88_wbNxPkglG6zLUhvzvxvDimuEc), especially:
>  - [Keynote - How To Build Your Own Infosec Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE5xS7-kFjE)
>  - [Keynote - The Infosec Survival Field Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJgqUJXtIMA&t=0s&list=PLbuNP88_wbNxPkglG6zLUhvzvxvDimuEc&index=2)
>  - [OAuth2: Beyond The Specs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBxI0bjtJvU&t=0s&list=PLbuNP88_wbNxPkglG6zLUhvzvxvDimuEc&index=7)

If you're a professional pentester or looking for a pentesting job, then you should really watch the talk "How To Build Your Own Infosec Company". It tackles a lot of topics: the advantages of small vs big pentesting companies, how to grow your own name and find your first client, how to organize your work and emails, plus many other tips.
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [RCE in Hubspot with EL injection in HubL](https://www.betterhacker.com/2018/12/rce-in-hubspot-with-el-injection-in-hubl.html)

This is a great writeup to learn about server-side template injection in HubL.\\
It's written like a tutorial, with details on how to go from detection (entering \{\{7\*7\}\} and getting '49' displayed back) to information gathering and full remote code execution.

### 3. Challenges of the week
> Hackerone challenges on [HackEDU](https://hackedu.io/)

Hackerone and HackEDU teamed up to offer the community 5 hacking challenges ("hackboxes"). These are great because they mirror real bugs found by Hackerone bug hunters and disclosed on Hacktivity, and they're free.

The bugs and reports are listed on this blog post: [Test your hacking skills on real-world simulated bugs](https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Test-your-hacking-skills-real-world-simulated-bugs).

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [The Paradox of Choice: Learning new skills in InfoSec without getting overwhelmed](https://azeria-labs.com/paradox-of-choice/)

As pentesters / bug hunters, we've all asked ourselves at some point: Where do I start? How do I become good at this? Or... How do I master it?

These are questions that Azeria already tried to answer in a [previous talk](http://azeria-labs.com/downloads/Paradox-Of-Choice_Azeria.pdf) and is now digging deeper in this new mini-series.

I strongly recommend reading both no matter where you are on the pentest / bug hunting mastery spectrum. Trying the strategy presented might help you deal better with the information overload that we all face in this field.

### 5. Article of the week
> [Blind XSS AngularJS Payloads](https://ardern.io/2018/12/07/angularjs-bxss/)

This is a good resource for digging deeper into Blind XSS vulnerabilities. It doesn't explain the basics, but includes a polyglot, a list of payloads and links about AngularJS Blind XSS in particular.

This is specific enough to maybe help you (and me) find less trivial XSS bugs.
