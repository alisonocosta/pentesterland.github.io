twitter-description: Tips & Ticks to make your life easier as a pentester & bug bounty hunter
---

If you're working on a challenge, vulnerable VM or CTF, you probably won't know its IP address and won't be able to get it with `ifconfig` because generally login credentials are not disclosed. So this is a basic tutorial on how to "guess" the IP address of a downloaded virtual machine that has DHCP enabled.

If you're a seasoned pentester/bug bounty hunter/CTFer, this blog post is clearly not for you. It is addressed to anyone starting in InfoSec, whether you're trying a first boot2root challenge or preparing for a job interview.

Why I am choosing this topic? Because everybody has to start somewhere. In my last corporate job, I created an intentionally vulnerable VM to assess the experience and technical level of applicants for a pentester job. The only information they had, was that the VM has DHCP enabled and their task was to find the maximum number of vulnerabilities.\\
To my surprise, many of them did not know where to start and asked for the IP address of the VM or the login credentials!

## Getting your attack machine's IP address
Here is how to retrieve your IP address (i.e. the IP address of your attack VM):
```console
# ifconfig eth1
eth1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.4.4  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.4.255
        ether 08:00:27:f7:d2:c0  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 1394  bytes 149194 (145.6 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 5276  bytes 347790 (339.6 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```
## Getting the vulnerable VM's IP address
### Method 1: Finding live servers with Nmap
Then you can run Nmap to list all live hosts on the network:
```console
# nmap -sn 192.168.4.1-254
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-06-20 15:51 WEST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.4.2
Host is up (0.0016s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:30:07:F0 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.4.3
Host is up (0.0014s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:AE:29:FE (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.4.4
Host is up.
Nmap done: 254 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 2.13 seconds
```

As you can see, in this example, there are 3 IP addresses on the Virtualbox Host only network:
- 192.168.4.3: Virtualbox DHCP server (You can get this info from Virtualbox's "Host Network Manager" *)
- **192.168.4.3: _Bsides Vancouver 2018_ VM**
- 192.168.4.4: Kali Linux "attack" VM

### Method 2: Finding live servers with Netdiscover

Another tool for getting live hosts is Netdiscover. Instead of sending ICMP (ping) requests like `nmap -sn` does, it sends out ARP requests and returns which hosts responded:

```console
# netdiscover -P -i eth1 -r 192.168.4.0/24
 _____________________________________________________________________________
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname      
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 192.168.4.2     08:00:27:5a:06:db      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
 192.168.4.3     08:00:27:ae:29:fe      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH

-- Active scan completed, 2 Hosts found.
```

### Method 3: Port scanning all your network 
If you want to be sure, you can also port scan all your network. This is the easiest but slowest method since you're scanning every open port on your network.\\
Intentionally vulnerable VMs will generally have more open ports than your own attack or desktop machines:
```console
# nmap -n -sV 192.168.4.1-254
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-06-25 17:55 WEST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.4.2
Host is up (0.00027s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.4.2 are filtered
MAC Address: 08:00:27:5A:06:DB (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

Nmap scan report for 192.168.4.3
Host is up (0.00035s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.5
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 5.9p1 Debian 5ubuntu1.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.2.22 ((Ubuntu))
MAC Address: 08:00:27:AE:29:FE (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Nmap scan report for 192.168.4.4
Host is up (0.0000060s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.4.4 are closed

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 254 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 13.76 seconds
```
