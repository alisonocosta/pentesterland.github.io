twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 08 of February to 15 of February.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tool of the week
> [Dnsgrep](https://github.com/erbbysam/DNSGrep) & [Tutorial](https://blog.erbbysam.com/index.php/2019/02/09/dnsgrep/)

This is a great new tool for quickly searching large DNS datasets like those from the Rapid7 Project Sonar.

It's like *grep* except it can search dozens of gigabytes of data really fast.

You can either install it and use it locally, or use the [online version](https://dns.bufferover.run/dns?q=google). But the author said he will likely take down the online service in the future.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [CSRF on Facebook](https://ysamm.com/?p=185)($25,000)

This is what a $25,000 bug on Facebook looks like!

The URL `https://www.facebook.com/comet/dialog_DONOTUSE/?url=XXXX` triggers a POST request to whatever relative path is specified in XXXX. The problem is that it also adds a CSRF token automatically to the request body, which makes it vulnerable to CSRF.

Basically, leveraging this vulnerable URL allows executing any other POST request while bypassing CSRF protections. The writeup details many different ways to exploit this: how to delete other user accounts, post on someone else's timeline, delete profile pictures and most importantly perform account takeovers.

This is a great example of a well written detailed writeup, which includes business impacts and technical details. The bounty is well deserved!

### 3. Video of the week
> [Web Security 101 - Insecure Direct Object Reference - You are who you say you are, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rloqMGcPMkI)

PwnFunction is an excellent Youtube channel for anyone interested in Web app hacking. The style reminds me of a mix between Hacker101 and LiveOverflow.

This particular video explains how IDOR works, the link with forced browsing and HTTP parameter pollution, what to do when you find an IDOR but cannot exploit it, how to bypass checks, etc.

Also, I love the humor... "Most of you might add a single or double quote at the end (of a URL like `website.com/...?user_id=12`) because it's just an OCD thing at this point" :D

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [Salary Negotiation Tips from White Men in Tech: Part 1](https://keirstenbrager.tech/salarytips-part1/)

This is a must read article for any woman in this industry.

I don't understand why, but we generally have a tendency to ask for lower salaries than men. I noticed this from my own experience in two different countries (in Europe and Africa), and also from interviewing people. Men with a lot less qualifications than the women we finally hired were asking for much higher salaries.

When I was interviewed for my last job as a consultant, I was able to get a really good salary only thanks to my husband. He coached me on what to ask for, how to negotiate, the minimal salary that I would accept, etc. And the minimum he told me was sky high in my mind and I was very uncomfortable asking for that. But guess what... I got it and deserved it regarding the job that I had to do!

So if you are looking for a job or for a raise, and you have trouble asking for what you're really worth, the tangible advice in this article could help a lot.

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [[Sqli] Extracting data without knowing columns names](https://blog.redforce.io/sqli-extracting-data-without-knowing-columns-names/) & [Similar technique](https://twitter.com/iamnoooob/status/1095005191663890433)

This is a great tutorial on how to exploit an SQL injection without knowing column names.

You might need this if you can't get column names because a WAF blocks calls to information_schema, and bruteforcing the names doesn't work.

The trick is to use `select 1,2,3,4,5,6 union select * from users;` instead of `select * from users;`.
