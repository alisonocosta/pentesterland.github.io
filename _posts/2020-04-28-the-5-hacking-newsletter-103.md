twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 17 to 24 of April.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Paper of the week
> [Uninitialized Memory Disclosures in Web Applications](https://blog.silentsignal.eu/2020/04/20/uninitialized-memory-disclosures-in-web-applications/)

This is an excellent paper on memory disclosure vulnerabilities in Web apps. The author focuses on bugs caused by image parsing  errors, such as ImageTragick, but shows how to extrapolate the attacks to libraries other than ImageMagick.

If you want to take a deep dive into this kind of bugs, this is a great opportunity. A lot of resources are provided from tools for automated detection, to a test environment, writeups, and external links on memory leaks.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Abusing HTTP Path Normalization and Cache Poisoning to steal Rocket League accounts](https://samcurry.net/abusing-http-path-normalization-and-cache-poisoning-to-steal-rocket-league-accounts/)

What a great read! @samwcyo chained HTTP cache poisoning with an open redirect that leaks the victim's OAuth token. He explains each bug separately, how to combine them for maximum impact, what he tried that didn't work, and also how he approaches hacking video games as a Web app tester without mastering reverse engineering.

### 3. Videos of the week
> - [Hacker101 - JavaScript for Hackers (Created by @STÖK)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTeE3OrTNoA)
> - [Creating Wordlists for Pentesting & Bug Bounty Hunting Using Seclists, Bigquery, and More!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGbTaxtEQlg)
> - [@Ngalongc Talks About Hacking Uber, Airbnb and Shopify, SAML/OAuth Vulnerabilities, Recon, and More!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HE68I4hILg)

If you're short on time, these 3 videos are what you need to check out from this whole newsletter. @tomnomnom shows how to analyze JavaScript and find bugs in the DOM using Chrome dev tools. @NahamSec shares how to create custom wordlists, and how to know which one you need to use. And @Ngalongc talks about his bug hunting journey, how he went from working in another industry with no security or developer background, to being a bug bounty millionaire, the type of bugs he focuses on, his recon process, etc.

### 4. Tutorial & Tool of the week
> - [Subdomain Enumeration: Filter Wildcard Domains](https://0xpatrik.com/wildcard-domains/)
> - [gwdomains](https://github.com/thelikes/gwdomains)

Detecting and filtering out wildcard subdomains is important during subdomain enumeration, to avoid wasting time on subdomains that don't exist. @0xpatrik published a cool post on exactly that.

Gwdomains automates this process. But I'm not sure how it works exactly. It would be interesting to figure it out by reading the source code, and to compare it with @0xpatrik's detection heuristic and all the cases he mentioned. 

### 5. Resource of the week
> [Public Release of HTML5 attack and Defence course](https://blog.anantshri.info/public-release-of-html5-attack-and-defence-course/)

This is a nice introductory course on HTML5 attacks. It's a bit outdated but still a good resource to discover HTML5 technologies (CORS, DOM, Local Storage, Webworkers, Websockets, Iframe sandboxing...) and some of their common security issues.
