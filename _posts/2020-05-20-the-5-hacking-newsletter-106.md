twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 08 to 15 of May.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tool of the week
> [Wuzz](https://github.com/asciimoo/wuzz)

If you ever want to send HTTP requests for a quick test without firing up Burp/ZAP, this is the tool for you. It is an interactive CLI tool for HTTP inspection. It allows you to send HTTP requests from the terminal, while controlling everything from the headers to the request's type and data.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [$20000 Facebook DOM XSS](https://vinothkumar.me/20000-facebook-dom-xss/) (Facebook, $20,000)

DOM XSS through postMessage is trendy and lucrative. @vinodsparrow found one in Facebook's login button, and shares all the details in this cool writeup. The nice thing is, he not only shares the code to exploit it, but also explains what led him to believe that there was an issue in the first place.

### 3. Videos of the week
> - [Naffy (@nnwakelam) Talks About His Hacking Approach, Recon Methodology, and How to Get Started!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8tCX2X_u3Y)
> - [LevelUp 0x06 - Hacking The New Normal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIK9nm3mu-S5Q3_OKnifprF_voK98JC_0)

@nnwakelam is one of the current bug hunter millionaires, and is particularly known for his recon skills. It is awesome to have this almost 2-hour interview where he chats with @nahamsec about his specialty, extending the attack surface, plus many other things like bug examples, Burp, vulnerability indicators... Also, just in case, here is his [TL;DR](https://twitter.com/nnwakelam/status/1261112446380503040).

LevelUp is also a rendez-vous I never miss. Topics range from automotive testing to security code review, writing résumés, choosing targets, and making better decisions as bug hunters.

### 4. Non technical items of the week
> - [Don’t Force Yourself to Become a Bug Bounty Hunter](https://samcurry.net/dont-force-yourself-to-become-a-bug-bounty-hunter/)
> - [Pushing yourself through hard hunting days: A bug hunter’s perspective](https://medium.com/@manas_hunter/pushing-yourself-through-hard-hunting-days-a-bug-hunter-perspective-d03b4c16b04)

These are two good pieces that point out important questions every struggling bug hunter should ask themselves. The idea is to find out what is hindering you. So, even if these exact questions don't apply to you, try to extrapolate to find your own missing pieces. 

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [How To Scan AWS's Entire IP Range to Recon SSL Certificates](https://www.daehee.com/scan-aws-ip-ssl-certificates/)

This article expands on an idea mentioned in Naffy's interview, that is scanning AWS's entire IP range and identifying certificates belonging to your target. This is done by chaining existing open source tools.
