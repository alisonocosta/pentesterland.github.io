## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tips of the week
> [5 Tips Bug Bounty Programs *Want* You to Know About](https://medium.com/@d0nut/5-tips-bug-bounty-programs-want-you-to-know-about-544d29888aeb) by @d0nutptr

Lately on Twitter, there has been a lot of controversy/noise/discontentment around bug bounty platforms, particularly HackerOne. Personally, I believe that the best way to succeed and be happy at work in general is to have a flawless attitude, give constructive criticism, then, if you're really not happy with your work environment, move on to another one.

With this same spirit, this blog post offers great information that could help you improve your bug hunting experience. It's a must read.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Thick Client - Attacking databases the fun/easy way](https://medium.com/@mantissts/thick-client-attacking-databases-the-fun-easy-way-6e31162b1335) by Richard Clifford

This is a very simple bug with high impact: by analyzing a desktop application's traffic, Richard found database credentials sent over a clear-text connection. He used them to remotely connect to the database, dump its contents and (because it was running as SYSTEM!) create new users on the system and pivot through the network.

Testing thick clients is not necessarly complicated and could allow you to discover high reward bugs without much effort.

### 3. Tool of the week
> [gimmecredz](https://github.com/0xmitsurugi/gimmecredz) for Linux by @0xmitsurugi
> [PassCat](https://www.twelvesec.com/2018/09/28/passcat-a-windows-passwords-recovery-tool/) for Windows by @maldevel

These are two tools to use post-exploitation, to extract passwords from many known locations like files, browsers, apps, etc.

There are many cheatsheets out there to follow once you have a foothold on a target, and also tools for generic information gathering and privilege escalation, but it's the first time I see tools that gather credentials specifically.
This is very handy for pentesters, especially if you lack time and want to quickly gather sensitive information for a PoC or for pivoting.

### 4. Tutorial of the week
> [Static Analysis of Client-Side JavaScript for pen testers and bug bounty hunters](https://blog.appsecco.com/static-analysis-of-client-side-javascript-for-pen-testers-and-bug-bounty-hunters-f1cb1a5d5288) by @yamakira_

Ah, JavaScript! So many good bugs disclosed by bug hunters are found by manual analysis of JavaScript code: sensitive information disclosure, new endpoints, hardcoded credentials, usage of dangerous functions...
So even if I have an aversion for source code analysis, JavaScript bugs are too good to ignore.

This tutorial is a very nice start: It explains how to obtain JavaScript files, make the code readable and identify common vulnerabilities manually or using tools.

### 5. Resource of the week
> [BugBountyNotes](https://www.bugbountynotes.com/), particularly the [Challenges & Tutorials](https://www.bugbountynotes.com/training) section by @zseano

@zseano did an amazing job with this site! It has several good sections all dedicated to bug hunting: forum, challenges, tutorials, references to tools, bug bounty programs, disclosed bugs...  Other features are also on the way.

If you haven't already checking it out, I recommended starting with the challenges and the [Hacking with ZSeano: Recon Part two](https://www.bugbountynotes.com/training/tutorial?id=6) tutorial.
