twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 06 to 13 of March.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [BSidesSF 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g), especially:
  - [Panel: Let's Get 360 w/Bug Bounty!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZFC6xH23pk&list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g&index=9&t=0s)
  - [The GCP Metadata API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5hPU3g2aZ8&list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g&index=38&t=0s)
  - [How To Write Like It's Your Job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhEUw90C_lA&list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g&index=55&t=0s)
  - [The Voight-Kampff Test for Discovering Vulnerabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LHl8KyDRPg&list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g&index=12&t=0s)
  - [Panel: Mental Health for Hackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raH7tRy8M7g&list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g&index=54&t=0s)
  - [Non-Political Security Learnings from the Mueller Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLyGN1L9Qo&list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g&index=16&t=0s)
  - [Transform Your Presentation Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDI32BRr2pY&list=PLbZzXF2qC3RvlcHIxrqrsN1XhwHX8SQ-g&index=30&t=0s)

The range of (interesting) topics tackled in this conference is amazing. There are at least 10 talks I really need to watch. During these difficult times of Coronavirus quarantine / social distancing, this is an excellent way to pass time.

### 2. Writeups of the week
> - [The unexpected Google wide domain check bypass](https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/google/2020/03/08/the-unexpected-google-wide-domain-check-bypass/) (Google, $6,000)
> - [Mass account takeovers using HTTP Request Smuggling on https://slackb.com/ to steal session cookies](https://hackerone.com/reports/737140) (Slack, $6,500)

These are two very impressive findings! The first one was found by analyzing a Regex found in obfuscated JavaScript code. It was used for URL validation in a Google app. @xdavidhu found a way to bypass the check. The impact was low/medium, but he later found that the vulnerable code was part of a JS library common to many Google Web apps including Gmail and Google Docs.

The second vulnerability is an HTTP Request Smuggling CL.TE hijack attack found on Slack. It was possible to steal victims' session cookies by redirecting them to an attacker-controlled Collaborator server. The writeup is pretty explanatory. And the attack could have been exploited for massive account takeovers.

### 3. Video of the week
> [@Mrtuxracer Talks About Monitoring Endpoints, Binary Exploitation, Continuous Recon and More!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A0S2AkCLFg)

This is @NahamSec's latest interview, with @Mrtuxracer. I find it particularly interesting because of @Mrtuxracer's approach. He explains his unique recon process, talks about continuous monitoring of JavaScript files and endpoints, some of his custom tools, API hacking, etc.

This is definitely worth watching if you want to learn about bug hunting methodology, differentiating yourself, or which kind of custom tools other bug hunters are using.

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [Bug Bounty Hunting Tips #4 — Develop a Process and Follow It](https://craighays.com/bug-bounty-hunting-tips-4-develop-a-process-and-follow-it/)

"Admittedly, it can feel great for the first hour or so but after that, you can start to become bored and frustrated if you don’t find anything. And without a structured bug bounty hunting process, you probably won’t find anything new."

Do this ring any bell? This excellent article goes over how to create a high-level process for bug hunting. Apart from technical methodologies, some decisions can help avoid frustration. This includes choosing a bug hunting approach, deciding minimum and maximum time to spend on a target and minimum time for writing reports.

### 5. Article of the week
> [Bug Business #2 – Hacking, traveling and vlogging with @STÖK](https://blog.intigriti.com/2020/03/09/bug-business-2-hacking-traveling-and-vlogging-with-stok/)

There are only two publications related to bug bounty that I wait for impatiently and devour as soon as they're published: [EdOverflow's newsletter](https://us20.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=9644b6e6c0558cb3849b83293&id=daeaf4f8cc) and this new interview series.
The first issue was with [EdOverflow](https://blog.intigriti.com/2020/02/03/bug-business-1-inside-logic-flaws-with-edoverflow/). The last one is an excellent read if you want to learn how Stök juggles between different projects, his filming process, how he manages full-time bug hunting without pulling all-nighters (Early birds, hello!)...
