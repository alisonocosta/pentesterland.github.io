twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 1 to 8 of March.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tool of the week
> [Rescope](https://github.com/root4loot/rescope) & [Introduction](https://root4loot.com/post/introducing_rescope/)

Wow, I love this tool! Have you've ever experienced the discomfort of adding tens of targets one by one or playing with regexes to configure your Burp scope? If yes, worry no more!

It is now possible to copy a bug bounty program's scope from their page, paste it to a .txt file, and convert it to Burp scope using one command.

Rescope takes as input a file containing your target domains, subdomains, IPs, wildcard subdomains, etc. And outputs a JSON file that you can import in Burp to *automagically* configure your scope. In one shot, and no regex required.

Here's an example input file:
```console
In Scope:
Critical admin.example.com/login.aspx
Critical https://example.com/upload:8080
Critical *.dev.example.com and *.prod.example.com
High 192.168.0.1-2 (internal testing)

Out of Scope:
!EXCLUDE
bgp.example.com:179
*.vendor.example.com
192.168.10.9
```

It can contain any text and descriptions. The tool extract targets wherever they are. The only thing to remember is to put `!EXCLUDE` before to list your exclusions, because by default all targets found are considered included.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Facebook Messenger server random memory exposure through corrupted GIF image](https://www.vulnano.com/2019/03/facebook-messenger-server-random-memory.html) ($10,000)

This is one weird bug in Facebook Messenger for Android: @vulnano uploaded a corrupted GIF file with missing content body. The image displayed back contained data from previously used memory buffers. It was leaking data from memory! He noticed it because the image display had white noise, while it was supposed to be blank.

Also, when the images were uploaded with Facebook Messenger for Android, nothing happened. The weird images were only visible from the Facebook Web app.

Another takeaway is to not rely on tools without understanding what they do and how to do the same job yourself. @vulnano first generated corrupted images with [Gifoeb](https://github.com/neex/gifoeb), but they caused the app to crash. So he studied the GIF image format and generated his own images.

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [Hacking Web Sockets: All Web Pentest Tools Welcomed](https://www.vdalabs.com/2019/03/05/hacking-web-sockets-all-web-pentest-tools-welcomed/)

Web sockets testing is an area where dynamic testing tools are lacking. This tutorial introduces a great way to fill this gap.

It shows you how to use existing tools like SQLmap, Burp Pro active scanner or Commix to pentest Web sockets. This is done through a Web socket harness: a python script which acts like a proxy between the Web socket and the tool you want to run against it. It gets HTTP traffic from the tool, transforms it into Web socket traffic and sends it to the socket. Then does the opposite with the Web socket's response.

This opens a whole new world for fuzzing and automated testing of Web sockets!

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [How to write a report](http://10degres.net/bugbounty-howto-write-report/)

This is a great article on writing good quality bug bounty reports. Whether you have experience in bug reporting or not, I highly recommend going through the article and thinking of what could be improved in your reports.

It could help you gain more reputation points and avoid being asked for more details because the explanations weren't detailed or clear enough.

On this same topic, also check out the bug bounty writeups below. Some of them (especially those by Jobert Abma) are good examples of really well written reports.

### 5. Slides/Workshop material of the week
> [Using Docker with Kubernetes for automating Application Security and OSINT workflows](https://github.com/appsecco/using-docker-kubernetes-for-automating-appsec-and-osint-workflows): Repository for all the workshop content delivered at nullcon X on 1st of March 2019
> [Automating Application Security Bug Hunting: Improving coverage with better automation](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/bsidessf2019/65/Automating%20Application%20Security%20Bug%20Hunting.pdf)

Lately, I've been thinking about automation a lot. Using custom scripts to automate your recon is one thing, but automation [Bounty Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WYjSDZxFYc&index=21&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkilMUOZD4Tnvr8T9bFgjH&t=0s) style is at a whole other level. It involves tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Argo and Golang (for speed).

That's why I'm so excited about studying these two new resources:\\ 
The workshop material explains how to set up Docker with Kubernetes for automated testing. It includes source code and documentation in the form of a Gitbook.\\
And the slides introduce the framework [Intrigue-core](https://github.com/intrigueio/intrigue-core) which has an interesting Web UI and API.
