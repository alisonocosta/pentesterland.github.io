twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 01 to 08 of November.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [Piercing The Veil: Server Side Request Forgery Attacks On Internal Networks - Alyssa Herrera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J-5mTc2e8A&feature=youtu.be) & [Other Hack.lu 2019 talks](https://administraitor.video/edition/Hack.lu/2019)

The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FIfKRgO_o2l4r9-o66B7vUBv28DsXk9jfLW0YBLYABA/edit#slide=id.p) for this talk were published months ago, and I was really hoping for the talk to be public too. Alyssa is known for focusing on server-side bugs, especially SSRF.
So, this is a must watch for anyone who wants to learn about this bug class. It is also a good example on the kind of thinking and focus you need to find critical bugs and become an expert at a specific topic.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Bypassing GitHub's OAuth flow](https://blog.teddykatz.com/2019/11/05/github-oauth-bypass.html) & [TL;DR](https://twitter.com/homakov/status/1192489206565740546) ($25,000)

Who would have thought that playing with HTTP methods could bypass OAuth on GitHub and yield a $25,000 bounty?!

The bug exists because the same controller handles both GET & POST requests, and using a HEAD request instead is unexpected.

The controller relies on the HTTP method to determine whether it will grant access to the app or serve an OAuth authorization page. @not_aardvark used the HEAD method. It was routed as GET (Rails behavior) and at the same time, the controller treated it as an authenticated POST request, bypassing authorization.

### 3. Non technical item of the week
> [Deliberate Practice: What It Is and How to Use It](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory)

It is very easy for hackers to get distracted by all the information and topics out there and keep hopping from one subject to another. If you think you have the Shiny Object Syndrome, or if you find yourself spending a lot of time learning and practicing without seeing the results you would expect, then you probably need "deliberate practice".

This article is a great introduction to this concept, with many resources to go further.

### 4. Tip of the week
> [I get asked how I manage a full time job, content, steam, hacking on top of my personal life. I’m going to answer this once and only once: if you have time to waste on YouTube/Reddit you have time to learn how to hack. I go to bed an hour later and wake up an hour earlier](https://twitter.com/NahamSec/status/1191828784808415232) by @nahamsec

Every time I hear of some accomplishement by bug hunters like @nahamsec, @stokfredrik, @nnwakelam, etc, I can't help but wonder how they do it all.

A lot of bug hunters juggle between multiple jobs and/or passions. It is what I do myself, but self-doubt creeps up sometimes: Why does it take me so much time to learn X? It seems easier for Y person... Is it just about the talent/intelligence you're born with? Is it because they don't have a family life like you? Or because they don't need to sleep as much as you do?

@nahamsec shares his unambiguous take on the matter: sleep one hour later and wake up an hour earlier. Make the time and stop with the excuses!

### 5. Resource of the week
> [IntelX Tools](https://intelx.io/tools)

This is not a new site, but I've just discovered it while looking for good OSINT resources. And it is amazing whether you do OSINT, or reconnaissance for pentest/bug bounty.

It has a lot of categories: Email, Domain, IP, Username, Person, Phone Number, File... For each one, you can find a lot of tools at the same place and search them all at once.
