twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 5 to 12 of October.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Book of the week
> [The Art of Subdomain Enumeration](https://appsecco.com/books/subdomain-enumeration/) by Appsecco

The folks from Appsecco regularly share great information and tools on recon and particularly subdomain enumeration, including two [LevelUp](https://pentester.land/conference-notes/2018/04/25/levelup-2017-Esoteric-subdomain-enumeration-techniques.html) [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLdm4c1oLs) and now this free book.
I highly recommend it, but make sure to take notes and integrate the different techniques into your subdomain enumeration methodology to benefit from it.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [How I hacked modern Vending Machines](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-hacked-modern-vending-machines-43f4ae8decec)

This was a fun read! It's a bug found on vending machine's Android app: anyone could buy stuff with a zero-credit account.

It's a nice example of reverse engineering an Android app, detecting and exploiting weak database encryption.

### 3. Tool of the week
> [Certstream](https://certstream.calidog.io/) by Cali Dog Security

There are a lot of tools to monitor Certificate Transparency logs nowadays. Although I already use some of them like Censys, Crt.sh & Facebook's CT monitoring tool, I immediately added this one to my methodology because it presents a stream that is updated with SSL certificates in real time!

You can interact with the CT log stream using libraries provided in Python, Javascript, Go or Java.

### 4. Video of the week
> [Eliminating False Assumptions in Bug Bounties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV28JVK7afE) by Frans Rosén @fransrosen (OWASP Stockholm)

This is a relatively short talk but the advice given is gold, especially if you are new to bug hunting. Frans talks about ups and downs of bug bounty and some tips to avoid dupes, N/As and boredom.

For example, he recommends hunting on old programs with a large attack surface like Google, Facebook or Yahoo because they put up new code all the time and are less tested since most newbies go for the new programs.

### 5. Resource of the week
> [XSS Cheat Sheet](https://leanpub.com/xss) by @brutelogic

This is a good cheatsheet that can be helpful if you're stuck with an XSS filter or learning about this type of bugs.

It contains a list of XSS payloads broken down by context (HTML, JavaScript, File Upload, DOM...), exploitation examples ans other tips all related to XSS.
