twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 28 of February to 06 of March.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tools of the week
> - [FUSE](https://github.com/WSP-LAB/FUSE) & [FUSE: Finding File Upload Bugs via Penetration Testing](https://wsp-lab.github.io/papers/lee-fuse-ndss20.pdf)
> - [Pulsar](https://github.com/FooBallZ/pulsar)

Pulsar is described as a Network footprint scanner platform. I didn't get to test it yet, but it looks promising. It is a wrapper around many recon tools, automates many recon features like subdomain enumeration, cloud resources discovery and basic vulnerability scanning. You can run custom checks periodically, and results are presented in a very cool dashboard.

FUSE and its accompanying research paper are also worth checking out. It helped discover 30 file upload vulnerabilities in 23 Web apps!
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Facebook OAuth Framework Vulnerability](https://www.amolbaikar.com/facebook-oauth-framework-vulnerability/) ($55,000)

@AmolBaikar challenged himself to find a vulnerability in Facebook's "Login with Facebook" feature. And boy, did he deliver! He found a postMessage flaw that could allow anyone to steal user access tokens for vulnerable apps using Facebook's OAuth flow.

The bounty is of course impressive. But there is also the fact that this bug has been there for years (maybe up to 10!), on one of the most hardened targets.

### 3. Podcast of the week
> [Darknet Diaries EP 60: dawgyg](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/60/)

@thedawgyg made several appearances in the media recently. But I've never heard his full story before. Who better than Darknet Diaries to recap his adventures from chat rooms, black hat days, to prison then full-time bug hunting. Brace yourself for interesting hacker tales!

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [Technical Writing Courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing)

Writing is a skill every one of us needs to be working on. Being able to convey ideas in a professional, concise and clear way can make all the difference in the world when you are writing blog posts or bug bounty/pentest reports. I would even argue that writing is the biggest hurdle most hackers face, especially those of us who are not native English speakers.

This course is a fantastic resource for improving technical writing skills. It is the same one Google engineers take! I am definitely going to dedicate time for this.

### 5. Video of the week
> [Going from a Full-Stack Developer to $1M Hacker: @inhibitor181 Talks About Recon, Hacking and More!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OD6nUHR1l4)

Yep, another interview! This week's hacking motivation comes from @inhibitor181. @NahamSec asks him a bunch of interesting questions like how he got started, how he went from informative bugs to earning his living with full-time bug hunting, dealing with imposter syndrome, etc. Lots of fun, as always!
