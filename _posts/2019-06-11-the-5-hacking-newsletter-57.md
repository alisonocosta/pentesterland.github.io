twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 31 of May to 07 of June.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tip of the week
> [Foxyproxy.json for disabling distracting Firefox traffic from Burp](https://twitter.com/liamosaur/status/1135427284704251904)

If you're a regular Firefox + Burp user, you probably have noticed that Firefox generates some traffic that shows up in Burp, like requests to http://detectportal.firefox.com/ or update checks.

This JSON file is @liamosaur's Foxyproxy configuration file that allows him to disables this unwanted traffic.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Ability to reset password for account on Upserve](https://hackerone.com/reports/322985) ($3,500)

This isn't a fully disclosed writeup, but the little information shared is mind-boggling.

Ilya/exadmin was able to steal other users' password reset link by entering an array of email addresses instead of one email address.

The request's body looked like this: `{"email_address":["admin@breadcrumb.com","attacker@evil.com"]}`.

It would be interesting to see what the backend code looks like, but even without knowing this is an interesting idea to try on other programs.

### 3. Article of the week
> [Subdomain Enumeration: 2019 Workflow](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-enumeration-2019/)

@0xpatrik shares his new subdomain enumeration wokflow.

I know, there are already dozens (hundreds?) of subdomain enumeration articles out there, and @0xpatrik himself already talked about this same topic... but here he shows how he improved his methodology for more efficiency and better results. Interested yet? 

### 4. Resource of the week
> [Guide 001 \|Getting Started in Bug Bounty Hunting..](https://whoami.securitybreached.org/2019/06/03/guide-getting-started-in-bug-bounty-hunting/)

This is a great guide for anyone interested in Web app security or bug bounty. It has 3 sections that correspond to the following learning phases:

- Basics of Networks, Programming & Automation
- Learning about Vulnerabilities, Resource for practicing, Tools...
- Selecting a target, starting tests & writing reports

Each phase is explained with the necessary resources to get you started. So if you don't know where to start, this is perfect!

### 5. Tool of the week
> [DirectoryImporter](https://github.com/Static-Flow/DirectoryImporter)

DirectoryImporter is a Java Burp Suite extension that allows you to import directory bruteforcing results into Burp.
Until now, the alternative was to proxy bruteforcing tools through burp to check the results (or do it manually).

So this can be pretty handy. For now, only Dirsearch and Gobuster are supported. But you can add any other bruteforcing tool you want by adding a [parser](https://github.com/Static-Flow/DirectoryImporter/tree/master/src/parsers).
