twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 10 to 17 of April.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Resource of the week
> [Attacking and Auditing Docker Containers and Kubernetes Clusters](https://github.com/appsecco/attacking-and-auditing-docker-containers-and-kubernetes-clusters)

After last week's training on AWS and Azure, @appseccouk is now generously open sourcing another complete training course. This one is about hacking Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters. It includes documentation, Docker Lab virtual machines and an intentionally vulnerable Kubernetes cluster (Google Cloud).
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [JSON Web Token Validation Bypass in Auth0 Authentication API](https://insomniasec.com/blog/auth0-jwt-validation-bypass)

This is a nice writeup on bypassing JWT validation. The app checks that the algorithm is not `none`, but relies on a blacklist. Using `alg: nonE` bypasses the case-sensitive filter, and allows for forging JWT tokens for any user. @zantedotnz also shares the tool he used and links to resources on JWT hacking.

### 3. Videos of the week
> - [@hussein98d Talks About Bug Bounties, Recon Methodology, and Shows Some of the Tools He Uses!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3cTsAUansA)
> - [Attacking Secondary Contexts in Web Applications - Sam Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWmXEAi9z5w)
> - [Code that gets you pwn(s\|'d) - Louis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5_S_Yip3gc) & [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/snyff/code-that-gets-you-pwnsd)
> - [Using Interlace for organising tests, and multithreading over targets - @codingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPnKFgjhlRg)

These are the videos/talks I plan on watching in priority this week. Why? Because I want to learn about @hussein98d's recon process and bug hunting methodology, @snyff discussing less obvious vulnerabilities, how @codingo_ uses Interlace, and @samwcyo's attacks on secondary contexts.

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [How to Remember Everything : Using Roam for Bug Bounty Notes](https://medium.com/@bonjarber/how-to-remember-everything-3cf29540b5d5)

Choosing a note-taking app is such a never-ending rabbit hole! 🤦‍

After settling on Joplin, then discovering Notion's great UI and features, I'm now tempted to check out Roam. @bonjarber does a great job of explaining why Roam's  graph-based approach solves problems all apps based on a "hierarchical tree" have (including Notion).

### 5. Tutorials of the week
> - [The Wondeful World of OAuth: Bug Bounty Edition](https://medium.com/a-bugz-life/the-wondeful-world-of-oauth-bug-bounty-edition-af3073b354c1)
> - [The 5 Most Common GraphQL Security Vulnerabilities](https://carvesystems.com/news/the-5-most-common-graphql-security-vulnerabilities/) & [vulnerable-graphql-api](https://github.com/CarveSystems/vulnerable-graphql-api)
> - [Bypassing modern XSS mitigations with code-reuse attacks](https://blog.truesec.com/2020/04/03/bypassing-modern-xss-mitigations-with-code-reuse-attacks/)

Depending on the bug classes you are focusing on, these tutorials might come in very handy. The OAuth one will give you ideas for new attacks to test for. The GraphQL article will give you an idea of common GraphQL bugs, and it is accompanied with an intentionally vulnerable API playground. The last tutorial is an excellent introduction to code-reuse attacks, and how to leverage them to bypass the latest XS mitigations like CSP, WAFs and HTML sanitizers.
