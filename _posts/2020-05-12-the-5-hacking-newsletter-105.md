twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 01 to 08 of May.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Article of the week
> [Decrypting and analyzing HTTPS traffic without MITM](https://blog.silentsignal.eu/2020/05/04/decrypting-and-analyzing-https-traffic-without-mitm/)

This article revisits a known technique for decrypting TLS traffic of mobile apps. It shows why Man-in-The-Middle is not always the best method, since bypassing certificate pinning or client certificate authentication can be complicated.

The idea is to use Frida to steal the session key, sniff traffic with Wireshark and decrypt it in real time by providing Wireshark with the session key, and finally import the requests to Burp using the [PDML importer for Burp Suite](https://github.com/silentsignal/burp-pdml).

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [DOM XSS in Gmail with a little help from Chrome](https://opnsec.com/2020/05/dom-xss-in-gmail-with-a-little-help-from-chrome/) (Google, $5,000)

This is a cool DOM XSS found in Gmail. So, no recon, no looking for obscure or forgotten subdomains. @opnsec used the main site, focused on the postMessage API and understanding how the different iframes communicate with each other.

He used [postMessage-logger](https://github.com/opnsec/postMessage-logger) to make cross-frames messages visible in DevTools, and analyzed the different requests and JS code to get a working PoC.

Moral of the story: DOM XSS is still a thing, complicated front-end code like Gmail's won't be confusing if you know exactly what to focus on (e.g. postMessage), and if DevTools is lacking a feature, develop your own extension!

### 3. Videos of the week
> - [James Kettle (albinowax) Talks About Request Smuggling, Security Research, Hacking, and More!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8q-QuEpUkI)
> - [API hacking for the Actually Pretty Inexperienced hacker with Katie Paxton-Fear - OWASP DevSlop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmyAxfGV9c)

The first one is an interview of @albinowax. Anyone interested in Web app hacking, bug bounty or security research should watch it. He talk about his learning process, how he leverages automation and bug bounty for research, how he chooses research topics, etc.

The second video is a talk by @InsiderPhD on API hacking. She shares her approach, the bugs to look for, with demonstrations using a [custom vulnerable API](https://twitter.com/InsiderPhD/status/1257038326034583553).

### 4. Tool of the week
> [Transformations](https://twitter.com/jobertabma/status/1257126413699670016)

Transformations is a new tool by @jobertabma that helps find out how inputs are transformed by Web apps. For instance, let's say that a server responds with `c1aa46d751f1ffa58481418667134109ac5f573c`, when you give it `test`. Feeding both strings to the tool will tell you that the transformations performed are `stringReverse(sha1(md5(md5("test"))))`.

This can be useful for building payloads that bypass WAFs, or understanding seemingly random strings.

### 5. Tips of the week

> - [One of my best hacking tips: NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING!](https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1258143118865530881)

These are the sweetest tips for bug hunters. @hakluke started tweeting short videos, each answering a specific question like the ones above. I love that he tells concise, no BS truths, in a light tone, the way only a real friend would do.
