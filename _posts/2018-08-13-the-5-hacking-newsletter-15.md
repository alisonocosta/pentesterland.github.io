## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Writeup of the week
> [How I gained commit access to Homebrew in 30 minutes](https://medium.com/@vesirin/how-i-gained-commit-access-to-homebrew-in-30-minutes-2ae314df03ab) by Eric Holmes (@vesirin)

Eric was able to make an unauthorized commit to Homebrew’s GitHub repositories. It took 4 steps and less than 30 minutes:
- He used [Gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) to automate the organization's Github recon
- He looked at previously disclosed issues on <https://hackerone.com/Homebrew> and found a Jenkins instance (intentionally) publicly exposed
- Git authenticated push meant that credentials were stored somewhere...
- The "Environment Variables" page exposed a valid GitHub API token

### 2. Tips of the week
> [Colorize your hunt](http://10degres.net/colorize-your-hunt/) by Gwendal Le Coguic (@gwendallecoguic)

Another great blog post by Gwendal Le Coguic! He presents his configuration to test for IDOR & vertical/horizontal escalation:
- [Autochrome](https://github.com/nccgroup/autochrome) browser: many options configured by default, separate profiles
- [Multi-Browser Highlighting](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/29fb77b2611d4c27a9a0b8bc504d8ca2): Burp extension that highlights the Proxy history to differentiate requests made by different browsers
- [Logger++](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/470b7057b86f41c396a97903377f3d81): Bup extension to log the requests and responses made by all Burp tools, and display them in a sortable table

### 3. Videos of the week
> [Bugcrowd University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIK9nm3mu-S4K4jMHwtplbrE1JMg0jyN-) videos & [Github repository](https://github.com/bugcrowd/bugcrowd_university) by Bugcrowd

Many of us have been waiting for the release of Bugcrowd University, since it was first announced during Level Up 0x02.

It currently includes links to previous LevelUp talks and beginner modules with videos, slides and lab guides. If you're a seasoned bug hunter, still keep a look at it because a few more advanced modules are also planned.

### 4. Tutorial of the week
> [Practical Web Cache Poisoning](https://portswigger.net/blog/practical-web-cache-poisoning) by James Kettle (@albinowax)
> <https://hackxor.net/mission?id=8>

James Kettle published this blog post following his Black Hat talk on "How to compromise websites by using esoteric web features to turn their caches into exploit delivery systems, targeting everyone that makes the mistake of visiting their homepage.".

I haven't finished reading and digesting everything but it is a must for bug hunters. The techniques presented have already been added as new features to Burp Suite 1.7.37.

Also, you can test your knowledge on Web cache poisoning by trying Jame's [challenge](https://hackxor.net/mission?id=8).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the web cache poisoning hackxor mission. If you want a brutal challenge, try solving it without first reading my research <a href="https://t.co/C2raIlrU4U">https://t.co/C2raIlrU4U</a></p>&mdash; James Kettle (@albinowax) <a href="https://twitter.com/albinowax/status/1027713024709120000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2018</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/329EVT6P0X">https://t.co/329EVT6P0X</a> is currently experiencing some intermittent problems thanks to the new cache poisoning mission. I hope to get this properly fixed tomorrow but for now, the server will reset hourly.</p>&mdash; James Kettle (@albinowax) <a href="https://twitter.com/albinowax/status/1027941173195726848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2018</a></blockquote>

### 5. Non technical item of the week
> [This is how i fixed my chronic lower back pain](https://adityaagrawal.in/2018/08/05/this-is-how-i-fixed-my-chronic-lower-back-pain/) by Aditya Agrawal (@exploitprotocol)

If you're on this blog, it probably means that you're into infosec and spend a great deal of time sitting on a desk in front of your computer.\\
I prefer working from bed or a sofa, but it still means sitting 8 to 10 hours every single day! I've had crippling knee issues for years and needed orthopedic soles to avoid pain but did not link it to having weak hips and knees from sitting all the time.

I've only recently arrived to the same conclusion as Aditya: Incorporating simple consistent habits into my daily routine is key to maintaining a healthy body (especially since I work from home).\\
It's inspiring to read how he was able to fix his lower back pain. I plan on trying some of his advice starting with the [Strechtly](https://hovancik.net/stretchly/) app.
