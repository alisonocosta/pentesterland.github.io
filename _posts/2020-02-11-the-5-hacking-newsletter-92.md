twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 31 of January to 07 of February.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tools of the week
> - [Quiver](https://github.com/stevemcilwain/quiver) & [Introduction](https://medium.com/@gulfsteve/quiver-4e675585f7ca) 
> - [PlaystoreDownloader](https://github.com/ClaudiuGeorgiu/PlaystoreDownloader)

The first tool tries to solve the inconvenience all bug hunters and pentesters face: Having to use so many different tools, to remember their command line options, to juggle between terminals and note-taking apps, copy-pasting commands...

Quiver allows you to run recon scripts or single commands organized into categories with auto-completion, and to access markdown notes from the terminal. This last feature is really interesting. It makes it possible to manage a markdown knowledge base that can be accessed from both GUI (with an app like Joplin) and CLI.

The second tool is handy for Android application tests. It helps download APKs directly from the Google Play Store using the command line. Practical if you want to automate APK downloads.

### 2. Video of the week
> [@Th3G3nt3lman Shares His Recon Methodology and How He Consistently Collects $15,000 Bounties!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1fwTcfp_so) & [Summary notes](https://pastebin.com/dyNMPAAJ)

This is a must watch if you want to up your recon game. @Th3G3nt3lman shares so many good gems, especially on how he differentiates himself, and finds assets/bugs that everyone has missed.

He has a full-time job and hunts for only 4/5 hours a week. Using strategies like quick/smart assets enumeration (e.g. building custom short lists) helps him make the most of his time.  This clearly shows that time is no excuse!

### 3. Tutorial of the week
> [Expanding the Attack Surface: React Native Android Applications](https://blog.assetnote.io/bug-bounty/2020/02/01/expanding-attack-surface-react-native/)

Assetnote's specialty is reconnaissance. So it is worth listening when they're talking about expanding attack surface. 

This tutorial shows how to extract JavaScript from React Native Android apps (without decompiling with dex2jar). Then how to analyze it and find juicy information (think endpoints, API keys, Firebase credentials, etc). 

### 4. Conference of the week
> [Meetups at Checkmarx: API Security Concerns (Part II)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY6q583JWLc)

This is an excellent talk about API security testing. @InonShkedy covers multiple vulnerability types including mass assignments, CSRF (and how to combine them), BOLA, 2 complex account takeovers he found, etc.

The company he works for, @traceableai, also shared [31 tips on API security & pentesting](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/31-tips-api-security-pentesting-480b5998b765).

These are both awesome resources for anyone who wants to dive into API security.

### 5. Tip of the week
> [When testing for SSRF, change the HTTP version from 1.1 to HTTP/0.9 and remove the host header completely. This has worked to bypass several SSRF fixes in the past](https://twitter.com/thedawgyg/status/1224450254205927432)

Cool SSRF technique shared by @thedawgyg. Switching to HTTP/0.9 allows you to remove the Host header (because it is not required in this version as opposed to HTTP/1.1). This can help bypass fixes.
