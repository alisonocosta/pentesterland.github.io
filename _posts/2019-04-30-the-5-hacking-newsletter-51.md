twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 19 to 26 of April.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Challenge of the week
> [CTF Challenge](https://www.ctfchallenge.co.uk)

I haven't had the time yet to do this CTF, but it's on my todo list because it seems different. It's a Web CTF that involves multiple subdomains, directory bruteforce, and different attack vectors. 

So it's a nice opportunity to practice recon. But make sure to respect the rules (attacking the infrastructure/ports other than 443 is not allowed).

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Session fixation on Shopify](https://hackerone.com/reports/423136) ($5,000)

This is an excellent session fixation report. It is well-written, detailed and a good example of a real-life session fixation attack. So it's a great read if you want to learn about this kind of bugs.

Also, it's interesting to see how @filedescriptor found the bug and chained it with an out of scope vulnerability: He found an XSS but XSS was out of scope. So he kept playing with the apps and noticed that some session IDs generated didn't change after logging in, which meant session fixation. So he leveraged the XSS to exploit the session fixation.

### 3. Article of the week
> [“CI Knew There Would Be Bugs Here” — Exploring Continuous Integration Services as a Bug Bounty Hunter](https://edoverflow.com/2019/ci-knew-there-would-be-bugs-here/)
> [A list of the most common [secure] variables from 5,302,677 build logs on Travis CI](https://twitter.com/EdOverflow/status/1121759622019284993)

This is awesome research and collaborative work! I loved reading about:
- How they came up with this research topic
- How they started with a list of bug bounty programs, found their Github organizations (using Google), then their Travis CI projects (using a bookmarklet) 
- How they grepped through the sizeable data retrieved (using [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep))
- How the tools they used to fetch build logs were created with availability in mind (to avoid causing any service disruption)
- Which kind of information to look for when analyzing Travis CI logs
- Several examples of bugs found on bug bounty programs

### 4. Resource of the week
> [Keyhacks](https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks)

Keyhacks is a Github repo listing ways in which API keys can be checked to see if they're valid.

It can be handy to quickly show the impact of API keys leaked by bug bounty targets. It's particularly interesting after reading the research about finding sensitive information in Travis CI logs.

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [How to Hunt Bugs in SAML; a Methodology - Part I](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/), [Part II](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-13-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology-part-two/) & [Part III](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-16-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology-part-three/)

If you've come accross SAML during testing and didn't know which kinds of bugs to look for, these tutorials are for you!

They're a good introduction including how SAML works, common vulnerabilities, tools, a testing methodology, and resources.
