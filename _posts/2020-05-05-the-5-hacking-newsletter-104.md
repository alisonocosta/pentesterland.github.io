twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 24 of April to 01 of May.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tools of the week
> - [postMessage-tracker](https://twitter.com/fransrosen/status/1256167158217932800)
> - [semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep)

postMessage-tracker is a Chrome extension presented by @fransrosen in his "Attacking Modern Web Technologies" talk. It monitors postMessage listeners in all subframes of the window and logs everything, helping find postMessage issues such as XSS and data extraction bugs.

Semgrep is like grep but for code. Both hackers and developers can use it to detect vulnerabilities by looking for anti-patterns in code. Here are two examples of patterns to look for in Go: [1](https://twitter.com/snyff/status/1255629728016330753) & [2](https://twitter.com/snyff/status/1256003542722084864). Languages supported are Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, C, and soon PHP and Typescript.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Piercing the Veal: Short Stories to Read with Friends](https://medium.com/@d0nut/piercing-the-veal-short-stories-to-read-with-friends-4aa86d606fc5)

This is a very well-written and informative writeup on SSRF. @d0nutptr shares what he looks for when testing SSRF, and 5 interesting bugs he found that earned hime more than $4,800 in total.

My main takeaway is to start signing up to apps using Burp Collaborator emails like `user@abc123.burpcollaborator.net`. If you receive an HTTP request in addition to the expected SMTP message (email), there is potential for SSRF.

### 3. Videos of the week
> - [Finally! HOW TO solve the INTIGRITI Easter XSS challenge using only Chrome DEVTOOLS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhPsBMBDFcg)
> - [Mindset hacking with zseano - What am I thinking when I hack?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3biiaFSUCU)
> - [Mayonaise Talks About His Recon Workflow, How to Learn Different Topics, and How to Bug Bounty!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGLdv_4Iy44&)
> - [Mental Hacking 4 Better Bounties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roVg_wgGgxQ)

Hackers are sharing so much good stuff these days! In this week's must-see videos:

@securinti solves Intigriti's latest XSS challenge. He based it on a bug found in a live hacking event, and shares so many cool tips on using Chrome DevTools.

@zseano hacks a Web app live and thinks out loud, sharing his mindset and approach.

Mayonaise talks about his recon workflow and hacking approach, automation, learning process...

@stokfredrik shares advice on how to learn new skills, and dealing with duplicates. Personal development applied to hacking!

### 4. Non technical items of the week
> - [Raising your web hacking/bug bounty hunting game](https://medium.com/@sankethsharath/raising-your-web-hacking-bug-bounty-hunting-game-6104bb80aca7)
> - [Bug Business #3 – Zseano’s notes on hacking & mentoring](https://blog.intigriti.com/2020/04/29/bug-business-3-zseanos-notes-on-hacking-mentoring/)


These are two interesting reads that can help get into a successful bug hunting mindset. @zseano is interviewed about his unique approach and experience, and @sharathsanketh shares some of his realizations as a beginner bug hunter trying to up his game.

### 5. Resources of the week
> - [Mobexler's Mobile Application Penetration Testing Checklist](https://mobexler.com/checklist.htm)
> - [Daily-commonspeak2](https://github.com/cqsd/daily-commonspeak2)

Daily-commonspeak2 is an unofficial repo for [Commonspeak2](https://github.com/assetnote/commonspeak2) wordlists generated daily. Useful for subdomains recon!

The mobile testing checklist covers both iOS and Android. I like its simple format that helps remember everything to test for, with references and the tools needed.
