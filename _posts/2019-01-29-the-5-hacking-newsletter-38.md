Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 18 to 25 of January.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Article of the week
> [A More Advanced Recon Automation #1 (Subdomains)](https://poc-server.com/blog/2019/01/18/advanced-recon-subdomains/)

If you want to automate some of your recon tasks but don't know where to start, this is an excellent beginning.

A recon workflow chart is given as an example. This is the first article of a series. It explains how to automate subdomains enumeration using a Bash script, and includes commands, tools plus tips like how to check for wildcard resolution (i.e. false positive subdomains).

Looking forward to the sequel(s)!

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [How I abused 2FA to maintain persistence after a password change (Google, Microsoft, Instagram, Cloudflare, etc)](https://medium.com/@lukeberner/how-i-abused-2fa-to-maintain-persistence-after-a-password-change-google-microsoft-instagram-7e3f455b71a1)

Logic vulnerabilities are my favorite. This one is an authentication flaw found on big sites like Google, Microsoft, Instagram, Cloudflare & many more.

Ironically, it abuses 2FA. The first thing that Luke Berner noticed is that if you request a 2FA code and change your password, the 2FA code remains valid for 20 minutes. And you can make it valid for a longer period of time by waiting indefinitely in the 2FA input page.

From there he concluded with this attack scenario:
- The attacker compromises someone's account, enables 2FA, requests a 2FA code, stays on the 2FA page, then disables 2FA
- The victim changes his/her password to get back control of the account
- The attacker is still be able to access the account using the 2FA code, even without knowing the victim's new password!

### 3. Tool of the week
> [Turbo Intruder](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/9abaa233088242e8be252cd4ff534988): Burp extension link\\
> [Turbo Intruder: Embracing the billion-request attack](https://portswigger.net/blog/turbo-intruder-embracing-the-billion-request-attack): Article & Video\\
> [Debug.py](https://github.com/PortSwigger/turbo-intruder/blob/master/resources/examples/debug.py): Example script to help debug/diagnose issues with Turbo Intruder failing to connect

Turbo Intruder is a new Burp Suite extension for sending large numbers of HTTP requests and analyzing the results. Here are some things to know about it:
- It's open source.
- It's really incredibly fast because it's built on a custom HTTP stack.
- Despite its speed, it has a low risk of causing Denial of Service on the target server. According to @albinowax, "it's certainly possible but the low number of concurrent connections helps avoid this - it tends to just run slowly on struggling websites rather than overwhelming them.
- It doesn't need Burp Suite to run, you can launch it from the command line.
- It can be used for file/directory bruteforce, detecting race conditions or any other attacks that require more speed, duration or complexity that Burp Intruder

### 4. Conference of the week
> [LevelUp 0x03 2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIK9nm3mu-S61oMP7pie5d2t1Aah41Fji)\\
> Slides:
> - [Bad API, hAPI Hackers!](https://speakerdeck.com/jr0ch17/bad-api-hapi-hackers)
> - [AEM hacker approaching Adobe Experience Manager webapps in bug bounty programs](https://speakerdeck.com/0ang3el/aem-hacker-approaching-adobe-experience-manager-webapps-in-bug-bounty-programs)

Yes! It's that time of the year again. A new LevelUp conference with so many good talks on Web app security, social engineering, API, IoT and mobile security, plus some non technical talks.

A must, especially for bug hunters!

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [How to add a module to Metasploit from Exploit-DB](https://medium.com/@pentest_it/how-to-add-a-module-to-metasploit-from-exploit-db-d389c2a33f6d)

Have you ever found an Exploit-DB exploit that you wanted to test and didn't know how to do so? One very easy and quick way to use these exploits is to add them to Metasploit and use them as any other Metasploit module.

This isn't a new trick but it might be very helpful if you're starting out in penetration testing. I remember when I discover this, it was mind-boggling.
