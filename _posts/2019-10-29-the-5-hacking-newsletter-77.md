twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 18 to 25 of October.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tools of the week
> [Github-subdomains.py](https://github.com/gwen001/github-search/blob/master/github-subdomains.py)
> [Erlenc](https://github.com/rhelmke/urlenc)

Github-subdomains.py is one of many Github scripts shared lately by @gwendallecoguic for Github recon. It takes a domain as input and returns its subdomains found on Github.
Sometimes, this is just what you need for recon or OSINT!

Erlenc also does one thing: It is a command line tool for URL-encoding and URL-decoding data streams. It can be useful for scripting, or if you find yourself playing with URL encoding all the time during tests.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Don’t open that XML: XXE to RCE in XML plugins for VS Code, Eclipse, Theia, …](https://www.shielder.it/blog/dont-open-that-xml-xxe-to-rce-in-xml-plugins-for-vs-code-eclipse-theia/?preview=true)

Exploiting an XXE during a pentest unexpectedly triggered two DNS interactions instead of one. This led the authors to investigate, and discover that opening the XXE payload in their text editor was triggering the second interaction. 

What could have been neglected by others became the subject of very interesting research. From weaponizing the XXE to get RCE, to testing other products that share the same underlying vulnerable library... There are many lessons in this writeup, both technical and about mindset and tenacity.

### 3. Conference of the week
> [Kawaiicon 2019 - Liar, Liar: a first-timer "red-teaming" under unusual restrictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASSjkkr4OCg&feature=youtu.be)

This is the story of an unusual red teaming mission. I don't want to spoil it by saying to much. So, let's just that it is captivating, witty, and perfect for those times when you want to relax while still doing something hacking-related.

### 4. Resource of the week
> [Cloud Security Wiki](https://cloudsecwiki.com/)

This is a collection of links for cloud security (from both offensive and defensive aspects). They are organized by topic: AWS/Google/Azure Cloud, vulnerable apps, Kubernetes and Docker.

It is nice to have all these resources at the same place. It should help if you're interested in Cloud security and don't know where to start.

I am also realizing there are some tools and presentations listed that I haven't checked out yet.

### 5. Article of the week
> [Attempting EC2 Subdomain Takeover](https://enfinlay.github.io/ec2/deadend/2019/10/19/ec2-takeover-attempt.html)
  
Subdomain takeover get harder to find on bug bounty programs. This article breaks down a more subtle form of the attack which affects some subdomains pointing to EC2 instances.
Who knows, it might help you get some of those juicy bounties!
