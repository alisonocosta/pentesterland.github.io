twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! Before diving into the meat of this newsletter, I first want to thank all of you who send us emails regularly and who answered our questions on which topics you would like addressed in a podcast.

I haven't yet had the opportunity to answer all of you. But your input, queries and suggestions are well received and will be taken into account. Keep'em coming!\\
Life gets in the way with plenty of obstacles and projects. So change is slow but steady. I'm sure you can relate to this...

That said, here are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week. This issue covers the week from 11 to 18 of January.

Big thanks to Intigriti for sponsoring this newsletter!

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tool of the week
> [bugbounty.link](http://bugbounty.link/)

This is a URL shortening service. What's great about it is that it supports any protocol (file, gopher, etc). So it can be useful to test for SSRF or open redirects, and bypassing filters on certain URI schemes.
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Reverse engineering games for fun and SSRF - part 1](https://www.nc-lp.com/blog/reverse-engineering-games-for-fun-and-ssrf-part-1) & [Part 2](https://www.nc-lp.com/blog/reverse-engineering-games-for-fun-and-ssrf-part-2)

This is a great writeup if you want to learn how to hack thick applications. @tampe125 shows how he:
- Hacked an unnamed gaming thick application
- Set it up to go through Burp Proxy as a transparent proxy (by using his local /etc/hosts files)
- Extracted juicy information from the game's logs
- Reverse engineered a custom protocol using the logs
- Identified an endpoint vulnerable to SSRF
- Edited WebSocket connections to exploit the SSRF

It was only possible to configure Burp as a transparent proxy because the app didn't use certificate pinning.

### 3. Non technical item of the week
> [Are you submitting bugs for free when others are being paid? Welcome to BugBounties!](https://medium.com/@zseano/are-you-submitting-bugs-for-free-when-others-are-being-paid-welcome-to-bugbounties-9e0fdb40a837)

If you're interested in bug bounty, this is an absolute must read! @zseano, a confirmed and experienced bug hunter, is denouncing some bad practices from bug bounty platforms. For example, some companies have a **paying private program and a public one with the same scope but no rewards** (kudos and Hall of Fame only).

He surprisingly concludes by saying that "bugbounties are overhyped and not sustainable" and that you should only do bug bounty as a hobby, not full time. He himself counts on quitting full-time bug hunting this year.

Whether he has an [ulterior motive](https://twitter.com/nnwakelam/status/1086196890507640832) or not, one thing most people would agree on is: don't work for free, your time is too precious.

### 4. Tips of the week
> [Tip 1](https://twitter.com/yppip/status/1085521727155814400): Find yourself using the same non-default wordlists over and over again in Intruder? Add them into the default list! Intruder menu > Configure predefined payload lists\\
> [Tip 2](https://twitter.com/yppip/status/1085181991799087106): Sending lots of requests in Repeater and looking for specific text in the response? Use the find bar but also click the "+" and select "auto-scroll to match when text changes" to jump straight to what you want!\\
> [Tip 3](https://twitter.com/yppip/status/1084843389957431297): (on Burp Intruder) Hold Ctrl and click a column heading to copy the contents of an entire column to the clipboard (don't be put off by the lack UI acknowledgement)

I love these Burp tips by @yppip. They might help you save time and avoid doing repetitive actions like loading your payload files manually every time.

And if you want to see more tips of this kind, @Agarri_FR has ~100 pages of them: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fRKlf1DsZU) & [slides](http://www.agarri.fr/docs/HiP2k13-Burp_Pro_Tips_and_Tricks.pdf). They date back a little but a lot of them are still valid.

### 5. Resource of the week
> [Resources-for-Beginner-Bug-Bounty-Hunters](https://github.com/nahamsec/Resources-for-Beginner-Bug-Bounty-Hunters)

This one is for you if you dream of becoming a pro pentester or bug hunter and have absolutely no idea where to start. It's a short list of resources sorted by different categories: web, networking and programming  basics, XSS and labs.

These are not exhaustive resources, rather basics to master and get a solid foundation as a start.
