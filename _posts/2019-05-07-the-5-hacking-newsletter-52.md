twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 26 of April to 03 of May.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Video of the week
> [5 super important main-app testing tips for bug bounty hunters with STOK&Haddix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQg9mg4WNI&feature=youtu.be)

Any video by @stokfredrik & @jhaddix is a must watch! This one has 5 crucials things you want to do as a bug hunter:
- Don't limit yourself to the external attack surface. Log in as different users & try to find where the sensitive functionality is => access controls bugs & IDOR
- Find out how the site references you as a user (& what you're allowed to do) => IDOR, File upload, RCE
- Test all parameters => SSRF, LFI, RFI, Path traversal
- Content discovery => hidden paths, private data leakage => Authentication bypass, logic flaws
- Find out which business flaws the target cares about (other than technical bugs)

But this is not all. Watch the video. It's short but full-packed with information!

### 2. Conference of the week
> [Nullcon Goa 2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWv48qIcomCbp_YTldbGomIZADvwL0gYb), especially:
> - [Best Of Google VRP 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJwZfRXs83M)
> - [How To Use Bug Bounty To Start A Career In Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG_I1xMfLkQ&list=PLWv48qIcomCbp_YTldbGomIZADvwL0gYb&index=16&t=0s)
> - [Automating Security Testing with Functional Testing Test Cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLoGhdeJw3Q&list=PLWv48qIcomCbp_YTldbGomIZADvwL0gYb&index=19&t=0s)
> - [Getting to $10,000 – the variables at play in determining bounty awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9tbzgpe270&list=PLWv48qIcomCbp_YTldbGomIZADvwL0gYb&index=3&t=15s)
> - [Introducing the ASVS 4.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhWR7XkP5rg)
> - [Interview with Robert Baptiste aka Elliot Alderson [@fs0c131y]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qB1PMH0rD8&list=PLWv48qIcomCbp_YTldbGomIZADvwL0gYb&index=2&t=52s)

I really recommend watching the talk "How To Use Bug Bounty To Start A Career In Silicon Valley". It has awesome advice on leveraging bug bounty hunting to build a solid resume and find a job in Silicon Valley (or anywhere else). This includes which bugs and programs to focus on, which pitfalls to avoid, etc.

"Best Of Google VRP 2018" is also a good resource for bug hunters who want to succeed with Google VRP. Some of the advice applies to other programs too (like specializing in a product/attack vector).

### 3. Article of the week

> [Meet the Hacker: Inti De Ceukelaire - "While everyone is looking for XSS I am just reading the docs."](https://blog.detectify.com/2019/05/03/meet-the-hacker-inti-de-ceukelaire-while-everyone-is-looking-for-xss-i-am-just-reading-the-docs/)

This is an excellent interview of @securinti. What I like about it most is that the interviewer, @\_zulln, is also a hacker. So unlike most interviews of this sort, the questions and answers are very technical and mindblowing for anyone starting out as a bug hunter.

I highly recommend this read if you want to find out what sets apart successful bug hunters from beginners.

Here are some interesting excerpts:

> Many hackers look for bugs, I look for attack scenarios and then for the bugs. And it works for me as I get fewer duplicates. The downside is that I spend time researching ideas that sometimes yield nothing.

> Scanners do not detect logical bugs, because to detect them you need context, you need to understand the application and the business logic. While everyone is looking for XSS I am just reading the docs. 

### 4. Resource of the week
> [Android App Reverse Engineering 101](https://maddiestone.github.io/AndroidAppRE/)

If you're interested in Android app hacking, checkout this workshop. It's about reverse engineering Android apps and includes both theory and exercises. Just awesome!

### 5. Non technical item of the week
> [Mental Health and Security](https://blog.zsec.uk/mental-health-and-security/)

So many hackers suffer from at least of the mental struggles mentioned in this article: imposter syndrome, burnout, anxiety and depression.

I hear/read more and more testimonies on this especially on Twitter, and I have similar experience myself. Hacking involves so much learning/change/stress...

So it's nice to know that I am/we are not alone in this. And it is helpful to read a fellow hacker's perspective on these issues, and how he deals with them.
