Hi, these are the notes I took while watching the talk "How to Differentiate Yourself as a Bug Bounty Hunter" given by [Mathias Karlsson](https://twitter.com/avlidienbrunn) at OWASP Stockholm.

## About
This talk is about how to differentiate yourself from the crowd, to ensure that you are successful at doing bug bounties.

##  Bub Bounty Effectiveness
- Bug Bounty Effectiveness (BBE) formula:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/conference-notes/differentiate-yourself-as-a-bug-hunter/bbe-1.png" alt="bug-bounty-effectiveness-1.png" >

- 3 underrated ways of achieving BBE:
	- Effective recon
	- Golden goose bugs
	- Collaboration

## Effective recon
### Proactive recon (enumeration)
- What Mathias does **before he starts working on a program**
- It's the **enumeration of all assets & functionalities** included in scope
- Assets can include subdomains, stuff from open source intelligence, virtual hosts, web services, specific paths, the developers' Github accounts (=> information on how the backend works)
- Why?
	- **More known assets** = More code to test = <span style="color: green">Increase</span> bugs found
	- Things enumerated that are **harder to find** = <span style="color: red">Decrease</span> risk of duplicate
	- Things **harder to use/understand** = <span style="color: red">Decrease</span> risk of duplicate
		- Most bug hunters discard  them because they are intimidating
		- Examples:
			- Learn new technologies like Graphql
			- Get & test the pro version (paid)
	- **Automation** = <span style="color: red">Decrease</span> time spent
		 - Automate everything you can
		 - It doesn't have to be good, as long as you understand how it works
		 - Can be a Bash script that calls a bunch of Perl or Python scripts
		 - You **don't** want to do anything in your recon process **manually more than once**

### Reactive recon (monitoring)
- Always do **all the programs that you're invited to**
- Automation will allow you to detect changes in assets
- Why?
	- **Big change in known asset** = <span style="color: red">Decrease</span> risk of duplicate
	- **Asset changes** = <span style="color: red">Decrease</span> risk of duplicate
		- If you find an IP or subdomains with no port open, move on but continuously monitor them, in case a new service becomes available
		- You'll know even before the program notifies hunters of the change, on bug bounty platforms
	- **Visualisation**
		- Take a **screenshot** of the web service & **push it to Slack**
		- Will allow you to find bugs just by scrolling through screenshots, even when you're tired/not motivated

- Bonus: Accidental bug find
	- E.g.: Server with 404 error on the main page. Directory bruteforce => Just sending GET `/shudown` shuts down the server (Denial of service, $12,000)

- During your recon process:
	- **Collect your data creatively**
	- **Monitor your data carefully**
		- Don't dismiss the data you've collected once because it might become valuable even if it's not now
	-  **<span style="color: red">Don't forget to  store it</span>**
		- Most important point!

### Recon blindness
- Common issue among bug hunters
- It's when you do **recon for hours & end up so tired** that you don't have energy left **to test for bugs**
- Finding more info on a target is a never-ending process:
	- /admin
	- Web archive
	- Mail server
	- Shodan
	- Censys
	- Subdomain
	- Old software version
- Recon is a means to an end
- Data is useless unless you find bugs with it
- **Recon is super fun but don't over do it, finding bugs is the goal**

## Golden goose bugs
- Common question: How do I beat people doing bug bounty 24/7 with "an hour here and there?"
- With golden goose bugs!
- **Bugs/misconfigurations affecting multiple programs, but only a specific stack**
- For e.g. an easy to make misconfiguration of Apache
- **Not** to be confused with **0days** (where it's the vendor's fault)
- Examples:
	- **Subdomain takeover**
		- [Hostile Subdomain Takeover using Heroku/Github/Desk + more](https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/)
	- **CDN cache poisoning**
		- [Practical Web Cache Poisoning](https://portswigger.net/blog/practical-web-cache-poisoning)
	- **OAUTH redirect_uri bugs**
		- [How I Hacked Any Facebook Account...Again!](http://nirgoldshlager.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-i-hacked-any-facebook-accountagain.html)
- Why?

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/conference-notes/differentiate-yourself-as-a-bug-hunter/bbe-2.png" alt="bug-bounty-effectiveness-2.png" >

- So you can start doing research on a subject in the few hours you have here and there until you find one of these bugs, then look for it on bug bounty programs

## Collaboration
- Seems like a bad idea since you're splitting the bounty money with someone
- But it's not the case because when you collaborate with someone:
	- **Time spent is multiplied by 2**
	- **You** can cover different grounds & **do not duplicate each other**
	- You generally **find more bugs** & bugs that you wouldn't have found by yourself

Also:
- It's more fun
- You make friends

But:
- It's easy to **become jealous & envious** of others (My bugs!)
	- Work on it because if you can overcome that, you'll benefit from the positive side of collaboration
- **I found more bugs than you!**
	- **Be very clear on the terms** of your collab before starting
	- He recommends **splitting the bounty 50/50** because:
		- If you still feel it's unfair, pair up with people with the same competence as you
		- Or pair up with someone with less competence than you & view it as an investment to get them to the same level as you
	- Change "I found more bugs than you" to **"We found more than any of us could"**
	- If you can't you're **not ready** for collaboration

## Questions

Note: I'm paraphrasing here, not reporting exact quotes...

- Q: Have you ever hit backlists when monitoring targets & got yourself blocked out because you were monitoring too hard or too often? 
- A: My monitoring is very gentle. It happens but not often. I don't run tools like Nessus. I only send a few HTTP requests per day. They're spread out over time

- Q: [not clear, I understood something like: can you still hack a target even if they're using a WAF?]
- A: WAFs are really good at blocking automated attacks but not manual ones. If I detect a WAF, I either give up because it's a waste of time or figure out a way around it. Many times, it's possible

- Q: Do you do recon against the employees of your target? For example, trying to figure out what their programming style is based on what they published on public personal accounts
- A: yes, that's what a real attacker would do

- Q: Did you ever go out of scope & make someone upset?
- A: It's happens but accidently. Programs are pretty understanding, I never got into real trouble
