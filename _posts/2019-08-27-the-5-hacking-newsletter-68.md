twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 16 to 23 of August.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Article of the week
> [SSRF in the Wild](https://medium.com/swlh/ssrf-in-the-wild-e2c598900434)

This article is an analysis of publicly disclosed SSRF writeups.

@vickieli7 curated 76 unique reports, then read each one and categorized them following criteria like: vulnerable feature, presence of SSRF protection, criticality/impact, type of fix implemented...
 
She gives interesting statistics on each category. For example, 27 of the 76 bugs affected an image/file upload feature.

I love this idea of studying a vulnerability class by producing statistics based on specific criteria. This can be scaled to include other bug types and more writeups.

It's also a great idea to look for bypasses each time you read a writeup. This is what allowed @vickieli7 to find one bug while learning about SSRF!

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Information disclosure & SQL injection on U.S. Dept Of Defense](https://aaronesau.com/blog/posts/5)

The chain of bugs described in this writeup are simple but critical. File/directory bruteforce revealed a `Trace.axd` file that redirected to a login page.

`Trace.axd` is ASP.NET's trace feature that helps developers debug the app.

Tests credentials worked and gave @arinerron access to a lot of sensitive information through that debug page: tokens, passwords, new endpoints... One of them was vulnerable to SQL injection.

An interesting idea to keep in mind if you find a SSRF on an ASP.NET app, is to look for `Trace.axd` to escalate it.

### 3. Tool of the week
> [Burp Scope Monitor Extension](https://github.com/Regala/burp-scope-monitor)

This is such a useful Burp extension! It's easy to install/use, and allows you to manage a list of URLs marked as "analyzed" or "not analyzed".

You may already be using lists of endpoints during tests to keep up with large scopes, but now you can do it directly from Burp. It allows you to highlight requests, retrieve URLs from other Burp tabs, send requests you want to analyze to Burp repeater, import/export state files...

The only downside I see is that the import/export function makes my Burp freeze. I need more RAM but the other functionalities work fine.

### 4. Tutorial of the week
> [JSON CSRF To FormData Attack](https://medium.com/@osamaavvan/json-csrf-to-formdata-attack-eb65272376a2)

This tutorial explains why JSON CSRF is harder to exploit than CSRF: You can't send JSON Content-Type using an HTML form. You need AJAX which can be blocked by CORS.

So to exploit JSON CSRF, you either need to bypass CORS or one of the two techniques presented here: Change the request's Content-Type from `Content-Type: application/json` to `Content-Type: text/plain` or to `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

If one of these is accepted by the server, they allow you to exploit the CSRF by creating an HTML form, bypassing the previous limitation.

### 5. Non technical item of the week
> [Is It Time to Let Employees Work from Anywhere?](https://twitter.com/HarvardBiz/status/1163048416731176960)

I would have loved to have this study years ago when I was negotiating (rather begging for) remote work with my previous employers. Home office is one of the reasons that pushed me towards self-employment.

If you're in a similar situation, the results could help you convince management. It basically says that "If an employee has a strong track record and can do most of their work independently, research shows that allowing them to work from anywhere would benefit both the individual and organization".

Also, the study distinguishes between Work From Anywhere (WFA, meaning geographic flexibility) and Work from Home (WFH). The first gives more flexibility and people who transitioned from WFH to WFA had their productivity increase by 4.4%!
