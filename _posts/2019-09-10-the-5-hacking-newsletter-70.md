twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 30 of August to 06 of September.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [DerbyCon 9](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/mainlist), especially:
> - [To CORS! The cause of, and solution to, your SPA problems!](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/1-06-to-cors-the-cause-of-and-solution-to-your-spa-problems-tim-lanmaster53-tomes-kevin-cody) & [CORS Exploitation Framework (CEF)](https://github.com/lanmaster53/cef)
> - [REST in Peace: Abusing GraphQL to Attack Underlying Infrastructure](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/2-09-rest-in-peace-abusing-graphql-to-attack-underlying-infrastructure-matthew-szymanski)
> - [Assumed Breach: A Better Model for Penetration Testing](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/3-08-assumed-breach-a-better-model-for-penetration-testing-mike-saunders)
> - [Kerberoasting Revisited](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/stable-20-kerberoasting-revisited-will-schroeder)
> - [Old Tools, New Tricks: Hacking WebSockets](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/stable-35-old-tools-new-tricks-hacking-websockets-michael-fowl-nick-defoe)
> - [Full Steam Ahead: Serverless Hacking 101](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/3-11-full-steam-ahead-serverless-hacking-101-tal-melamed)
> - [Red Team Methodology: A Naked Look](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/2-12-red-team-methodology-a-naked-look-jason-lang)
> - [API Keys, Now What?Taking the Pen Test Into the Amazon Cloud](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/2-13-api-keys-now-whattaking-the-pen-test-into-the-amazon-cloud-jim-shaver)
> - [Red Team Level over 9000! Fusing the powah of .NET with a scripting language of your choosing: introducing BYOI (Bring Your own Interpreter) payloads.](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon9/1-17-red-team-level-over-9000-fusing-the-powah-of-net-with-a-scripting-language-of-your-choosing-introducing-byoi-bring-your-own-interpreter-payloads-marcello-salvati)

DerbyCon 9 had so many good talks! I'm particularly interested in the ones on CORS, Kerberoasting, WebSOckets, GraphQL, Serverless, API security & red teaming, but many other topics were discussed.

Too bad, this was the last DerbyCon conference!

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Add new user with Admin permission and takeover the organization](https://medium.com/@tarekmohamed_20773/add-new-user-with-admin-permission-and-takeover-the-organization-6318ee10154a)

This is the writeup a privilege escalation on a private program. Starting with a limited user account and no API documentation, the author was looking for admin endpoints.

He tried common ones like `/api/v2/member/`, `/api/v2/members/`, `/api/v2/users/`, `/api/v2/user/`... And noticed that existing and non-existing endpoints returned different HTTP codes.

`api/v2/user` returned a 405 (the method is not allowed). Changing the method from GET to POST, and adding all parameters reported missing by the server, he was able to construct a valid POST request and create a new user. But the reset password functionality didn't work for that user until he passed the right value (found by bruteforce) to a specific parameter during user creation.

Then he was able to create an admin user by adding “role”=”admin” to the request.

This whole process isn't complicated but I love how the author relies on parameters guessing and bruteforce, and also chains multiple actions to find hidden functionality and overcome any obstacle faced.

### 3. Article of the week
> [Same-Origin Policy: From birth until today](https://research.aurainfosec.io/same-origin-policy/)

The Same Origin Policy is an essential concept for Web app testers. This article presents the results of research on SOP and CORS on different browsers, as well as 2 CSRF bugs and how CSRF and SOP are related.

The author's conclusion: “do not use IE or Edge”... They violate the SOP standard, which makes them more vulnerable.

### 4. Tool of the week
> [gitGraber](https://github.com/hisxo/gitGraber)

This is a great tool for Github recon. I've never seen one like it for two reasons: it does live monitoring with Slack notifications, and it searches all Github not only organization repositories. So even if a developer has a profile that is not explicitly linked to your target organization, gitGrabber will still search for secrets in this repository.

The syntax is basically `gitGraber.py -k KEYWORDSFILE -q QUERY`, where QUERY can be your target organization (e.g. yahoo) and KEYWORDSFILE is a file containing keywords like access_key, password, auth...
The tool looks for sensitive data for several online services (Google, Amazon, Paypal, Github, Mailgun, Stripe...) based on regexes and notifies you when potentially sensitive information is found.

### 5. Videos of the week
> [TomNomNom answers questions for 4 hours straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMegA6cpKpE)\\
> [8/25/2019 - Live Bug Bounty Recon Session w/ @FransRosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTanLdLj5dY&feature=youtu.be)

This livestreaming trend by bug hunters is getting crazy! I find it harder and harder to keep up with the pace. But these two videos are on the top of my list of things to watch this week.

@tomnomnom answers questions for more than 4 hours. They touch on everything from his peanut butter preferences to why he doesn't do bug bounty full-time, burnout, VIM, getting into bug bounty, etc.

The stream by @NahamSec covers topics like asset discovery and API fuzzing, and a ~1 hour interview with @fransrosen. I'm a big fan of his, so it's awesome to hear about his recon approach, research he's working on, why he doesn't automate everything, etc.
