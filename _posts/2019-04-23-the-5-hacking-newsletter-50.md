twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 12 to 19 of April.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Resource of the week
> [Content_discovery_nullenc0de.txt](https://gist.github.com/nullenc0de/96fb9e934fc16415fbda2f83f08b28e7#file-content_discovery_nullenc0de-txt)

This is a new content discovery wordlist by @nullenc0de, to use for file & directory bruteforce with tools like dirsearch, dirb, etc. 
It's based on @JHaddix's content_discovery_all.txt dictionary but has 300k more directories/files.

As a comparison, here is the exact number of entries in these two and in *dirsearch*'s default dictionary: 

```
# wc -l content_discovery_all.txt
373535 content_discovery_all.txt
# wc -l /root/tools/dirsearch/db/dicc.txt
6087 /root/tools/dirsearch/db/dicc.txt
# wc -l content_discovery_nullenc0de.txt
623103 content_discovery_nullenc0de.txt
```
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [IDOR on Shopify](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/how-i-gained-access-to-revenue-and-traffic-data-of-thousands-of-shopify-stores-b6fe360cc369)

This writeup is a gem for so many reasons! I highly recommend reading it and paying attention to all the details:
- How @\_ayoubfathi\_ used automation to get notifications of new API endpoints (and not only new subdomains!)
- How he created script on-the-fly to during bug hunting to solve specific issues (like building a list of valid Shopify stores)
- How he leveraged a passive DNS database to get a bigger list of Shopify stores
- How he kept trying new approaches over weeks and solving one issue after the other until he confirmed the bug
- How he adapted a BASH script to bypass rate-limiting (WAF) even if it meants that the script would take days to run
- The mistake he made that rendered this awesome finding not eligible for a bounty

### 3. Non technical item of the week
> [Want to learn a new skill? Take some short breaks](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190412115055.htm)

Taking breaks from the computer is something at which I'm so bad! I get kind of obsessive when working on anything security related. 

But this study really motivates me to start taking more breaks. Researchers found that taking a short rest helps our brains retain more information learned a few seconds earlier.

So instead of thinking that rest is a waste of time, it's better to think that it plays a critical role in learning. More rest = More productity.

### 4. Video of the week
> [I accidentally started a live stream and it turned into #askstok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDyjR2lGazk&feature=youtu.be)

I love love love this live stream by @stokfredrik! Being relatively new to bug bounty and already getting good results (at least [financially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEC4UMygauE&t=113s)), he has a unique perspective. I think that's why newcomers can easily relate to his advice/experience.

So if you're learning bug hunting, and want to get practical advice in an entertaining format (he started live-streaming by accident!), this is the right video to watch. He answers questions like: Can you live out of bug bounty? Do you need to know programming? Is 2019 too late to start bug hunting?...

Let's hope he makes other Q&As. I love peeking at what other hunters are doing and the live interaction is a great opportunity to get instant feedback/answers.

### 5. Slides of the week
> [Piercing the Veil: Server Side Request Forgery to NIPRNet access](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FIfKRgO_o2l4r9-o66B7vUBv28DsXk9jfLW0YBLYABA/edit#slide=id.p)

Last tuesday, I was thinking about critical server-side issues and decided to switch my focus to SSRF for the next weeks. The day after that, @Alyssa_Herrera_ tweeted about this presentation!

It's a great introduction to this vulnerability class, including both theory and an example of SSRF found on a DoD site.

Just make sure to check out the comments below each slide (they won't appear if you download the file as PDF).
