twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 14 to 21 of June.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Video of the week
> [VIM tutorial: linux terminal tools for bug bounty pentest and redteams with @tomnomnom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8iXMgk2nnY)

Oh my! We're really spoilt this week between this video tutorial with @tomnomnom and @nahamsec's recon tips video (see below).

@tomnomnom shares so many tips that are worthy to discover whether your are a beginner or seasoned bug hunter. This includes the tools he uses for recon (including custom ones like [assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder) and [html-tool](https://github.com/tomnomnom/hacks/tree/master/html-tool)), BASH basics, how to manually search for secrets in Git repos, how to use (and exit) VIM and a lot more.

This is a must watch if you're into Web app security!

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Using Burp Suite match and replace settings to escalate your user privileges and find hidden features](https://www.jonbottarini.com/2019/06/17/using-burp-suite-match-and-replace-settings-to-escalate-your-user-privileges-and-find-hidden-features/) ($500)

@jon_bottarini shares here a technique that allowed multiple times to access unreleased beta and admin features (*i.e.* escalate his privileges).

The idea is that if you see the server always returning some "false" value, you can use Burp Suite's match and replace rule to change the server's response body from "false" to "true". Sometimes this triggers client-side code that was hidden or unaccesible.

Similarly, you can replace `"userlevel":READONLY` with `"userlevel":ADMIN`, or `"subscriptionlevel":"BASIC"` with `"subscriptionlevel":"PROFESSIONAL"`.

Pretty straightforward. Must try now!

### 3. Resource of the week
> [Collection of bug bounty tips](https://twitter.com/intigriti/status/1141990112659722240)

This is a remarkable Twitter feed initiated by @intigriti who asked hackers to share their best bug bounty tip. A lot of people chimed in. Here are some of my favorite responses:

- "Create daily diffs of JavaScript files to find new features, endpoints and keep an eye on endpoints that disappear but still work, they might conflict with the future design of the product and induce a vulnerability."
- "Sometimes your target asks you to pay to access an account/premium features. If they use services like "Stripe", try paying with "test cards" and check if you can have a premium account/features, for free!"
- "Change the host header to "localhost", its IPv4/IPv6 equivalents or even better the internal IP of the server!" and "if you get a 403 with that, adding X-Fowarded-For:localhost might do the trick! :)"
- "If http://bugbountytarget.com  does not verify e-mail addresses, try signing up with a @bugbountytarget.com email address! You may get access to special features or discounts!"

### 4. Tool of the week
> [Rock-ON](https://github.com/SilverPoision/Rock-ON)

If you're currently doing your recon manually, this will be a very handy tool. It's a wrapper around many staple tools and looks like a good basis to build upon and customize to your own needs.

I already have a custom recon tool. But regular readers of this newsletter know by now that I lo-o-ove going through repos like this one. I look for any good ideas that can be replicated and improve my own scripts.

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [How to: Burp â™¥ OpenVPN](https://honoki.net/2019/06/21/how-to-burp-and-openvpn/)

Bookmark this one. It will be really helpful if you need to direct all (and only) your Burp traffic through a remote VPN.

This is a little more complicated than running a VPN on your local machine, but sometimes you don't have a choice. Bug bounty program and pentest client can require that you use a remote VPN.

So check out this awesomly detailed guide. You will need PuTTY, OpenVPN, one VPS or two (if you have a dynamic IP) and the Switchy Omega browser extension.
