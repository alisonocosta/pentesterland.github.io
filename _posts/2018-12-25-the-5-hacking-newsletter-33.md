twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 14 to 21 of December.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [KringleCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiR-C_VXv_TCFgww5Vczag/videos)

Kringle con, Kringle con, Kringle all the way... Oh what fun it is to watch hacking conference talks!\\
Hum, sorry for the little "Jingle bells" song hijacking, I couldn't help it!

More seriously, this is a great set of talks for penetration testers. They're rather short (approximately between 6 and 25 minutes), but are all interesting and cover many different topics: Kubernetes security, web app security (relevant for bug hunters), malwares, forensics, social engineering, and even community building (non technical talk).

If you haven't already watched them, it could be fun to do a KringleCon marathon. Bring the popcorn!

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Reading ASP secrets for $17,000](https://samcurry.net/reading-asp-secrets-for-17000/)

This is a great finding with a $17,000 bounty, but also a very well-written writeup. I highly recommend it to learn more on hacking ASP.NET apps, LFD bugs, and how to bypass path traversal filters.

Here's my favorite takeaway: Let's say you're testing for path traversal on `/utility/download.aspx?f=download.aspx` where download.aspx is a file that exits and you can read, and `..` is forbidden.

To bypass the filter, launch a Burp intruder attack on `/utility/download.aspx?f=.[fuzz]./utility/download.aspx`. Is there any characters combination which allows you to read download.aspx, meaning that it is equivalent to `../utility/download.aspx` but without `..`?

If yes, it means that that payload allowed you to successfully traverse between directories. In this writeup, it was `.+.` which did the trick.

### 3. Resource of the week
> [Cross-Site Request Forgery Cheat Sheet](https://trustfoundry.net/cross-site-request-forgery-cheat-sheet/)

This is a very cool and concise cheat sheet for CSRF testing. It's a flowchart to help determine if an app is vulnerable or not, and how best to create a proof of concept.

It may be helpful whether you are struggling to understand CSRF attacks or as a reminder/checklist even if you're already a CSRF master.

### 4. Tool of the week
> [pyHAWK](https://github.com/MetaChar/pyHAWK)

This is a simple Python script to use for post-exploitation. It searches any given directory for interesting files that have specific extensions or names.

It's not groundbreaking but it can be a nice addition to your arsenal. If you have a foothold on a server, you can use it to quick detect database files, files with passwords, configuration files, etc.

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [Hidden directories and files as a source of sensitive information about web application](https://medium.com/@_bl4de/hidden-directories-and-files-as-a-source-of-sensitive-information-about-web-application-84e5c534e5ad) & [Dictionaries](https://github.com/bl4de/dictionaries)

This is a great article which reminds me of the [Small Files And Big Bounties, Exploiting Sensitive Files (LevelUp 0x02 / 2018)](https://pentester.land/conference-notes/2018/07/04/levelup-2018-small-files-and-big-bounties-exploiting-sensitive-files.html) talk. It complements it perfectly as it presents additional types of hidden sensitive files and directories: IDE, SVN, NodeJS/JavaScript, Gitlab and Ruby on Rails files.

@Bl4de also shares the custom made dictionary of ~80k entries that he uses to find these files. So check out the article as well as the dictionary, there might be something useful to add to your methodology.
