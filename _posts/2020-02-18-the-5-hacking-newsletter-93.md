twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 07 to 14 of February.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Video of the week
> [@zseano Talks About BugBountyNotes.com, Recon, Reading Javascript, WAF, Wayback Machine, and more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH6O13hHf5M)

Lately, @zseano has been quieter than before. So, it is nice to hear him share insights on his recon process (e.g why he runs subdomain tools last), his hacking methodology, why he closed Bug Bounty Notes, and much more.
<!--more-->

### 2. Resource of the week
> [The Mobile Hacking CheatSheet](https://github.com/randorisec/MobileHackingCheatSheet)

No matter how often I use tools like ADB, Keytool or Frida, I always forget the syntax! These two cheatsheets are handy as they sum up commands that are most used used for Android and iOs hacking.

Its creators, [@RandoriSec](https://twitter.com/RandoriSec), have also been sharing a lot of excellent tips for mobile hacking on Twitter. It's worth checking out.

### 3. Webinar of the week
> [Security Reconnaissance With Codingo: How New Tricks Let Hackers See More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJa6JAQuI2o) & [Slides](https://github.com/codingo/Bugcrowd-Talks/blob/master/Security%20Reconnaissance%20Bugcrowd.pdf)

Watch this if you want to know the most notable bug bounty trends (tools and techniques) @codingo noticed in 2019. He focuses on recon and some bug classes like XSS, subdomain takeover, finding and testing API keys, etc.

I love that he explains the reasoning behind each idea. For instance, why reporting alert(1) for XSS is never the best idea, or why you should really not use sublist3r on its own for subdomain enumeration.

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [On Full-Time Bug Bounty Hunting](https://ajxchapman.github.io/bugbounty/2020/02/10/on-full-time-bug-bounty-hunting.html)

Should you give up everything and become a full-time bug bounty hunter? This unbiased feedback by @ajxchapman may help you decide. He tells his story, the pros and cons of bug hunting, and advice that helped him earn his living doing this full-time while living in London (not the cheapest town!).

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [Proxying and Intercepting CLI Tools](https://blog.ropnop.com/proxying-cli-tools/)

Have you ever run a command line tool and wondered which requests it was sending to your target? Knowing this can be valuable for pentesters and bug hunters. It helps understanding what the tool does.

The solution detailed in this excellent tutorial is to use Burp Suite as a proxy. The process is explained for curl, wget, Java JARs, Python, Node JS and Go binaries.

Another advantage of using Burp is that all requests sent are logged (with request and response times).

I can't tell you how many times pentest clients asked for what was being tested at X time and the number of requests, because they noticed network or server issues and wanted to determine if it was caused by the tests.
