This is a long due post.

Since [The 5 Hacking Newsletter](https://pentester.land/newsletter) has stopped on this blog, I've been getting many questions about it. So, even though most readers already know by now, here's a reminder of what happened.

The first one dates back to March 2018. After about 10 months, Intigriti showed interest in a partnership. They sponsored the newsletter, got to share it with their hacker community, I was able to continue it since I was paid, and you got a weekly newsletter for free. An incredible win-win situation!

Fast forward ~16 months later, we entered a new exciting phase. I am going to contribute more content for Intigriti. But as part of the new deal, they now have exclusivity on the Newsletter that is published as [Bug Bytes](https://blog.intigriti.com/category/bugbytes/). So, make sure to follow it there. And if you prefer email, here's their [subscription page](https://newsletter.intigriti.com/).

Does this mean you should unfollow Pentester Land?

Honestly, at this point I am not even sure of what's coming. It is difficult to think clearly when you're recovering from long-term burnout and overwork.

What is sure is that I'm lacking time nowadays to work on podcasts or content specifically for this blog. But the site isn't dead yet. The [list of bug bounty writeups](https://pentester.land/list-of-bug-bounty-writeups.html) is still regularly updated. I also have other ideas, but their implementation will take time (and finding trustworthy & competent devs ü§≤).

So, if you want to be notified of any future updates, you can remain subscribed to the [email list](https://pentester.land/subscribe.html). I'm also active on Twitter, if you want to [follow me](https://twitter.com/PentesterLand) there.

To conclude this short blog update, I want to thank all of you who support this site. You're often cheering me up, sharing sweet emails, DMs, feedback, and words of encouragement. I'm so grateful for this ‚ù§Ô∏è

Have a nice sunday y'all!
