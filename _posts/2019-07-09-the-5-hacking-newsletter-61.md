twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 28 of June to 05 of July.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Webinar of the week
> [Intro to Cloud for Pentesters and Bug hunters \| Security and Research Company (SECARMY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8NUJfDUvEg)

This is an excellent introduction to cloud security for pentesters and bug hunters. If you've ever felt intimidated by AWS testing, this is a perfect opportunity to tackle this topic.
You'll learn about cloud computing, the difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, common misconfigurations of four components of AWS (including AWS S3 and IAM) with examples and links to writeups.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [File upload blind SQL injection](https://jspin.re/fileupload-blind-sqli/)

I've never thought that the file name specified during a file upload could be saved to a database, and so potentially vulnerable to SQL injection!

It seems like an unusual entry point for this kind of attacks. So it's good to know and add to one's list of locations to fuzz for SQL injection.

### 3. Conference of the week

> [Pass the SALT 2019 videos](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/channels/#2019-lille) & [all slides](https://2019.pass-the-salt.org/files/slides/), especially:
>	- [Hacking Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x8BsBnQPmU&feature=youtu.be) & [Slides](https://2019.pass-the-salt.org/files/slides/12-Hacking_Jenkins.pdf)
>	- [Time-efficient assessment of open-source projects for Red Teamers](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/time-efficient-assessment-of-open-source-projects-for-red-teamers/) & [Slides](https://2019.pass-the-salt.org/files/slides/11-Time_efficient_%20assessment_of_%20open-source_projects_for_Red_Teamers.pdf)
>	- [Better curl !](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/better-curl/) & [Slides](https://2019.pass-the-salt.org/files/slides/25-BetterCurl.pdf)
>	- [Dexcalibur - automate your android app reverse](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/dexcalibur-automate-your-android-app-reverse/) & [Slides](https://2019.pass-the-salt.org/files/slides/02-Dexcalibur.pdf)
>	- [Mini-Internet using LXC (MI-LXC): A first step towards a free CyberRange ?](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/mi-lxc-a-first-step-towards-a-free-cyberrange/) & [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/flesueur/mini-internet-using-lxc-mi-lxc-a-first-step-towards-a-free-cyberrange)
>	- [JWAT… Attacking JSON Web Tokens](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/jwat-attacking-json-web-tokens/) & [Slides](https://2019.pass-the-salt.org/files/slides/09-JWAT.pdf)
>	- [KILL MD5 - Demystifying hash collisions](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/kill-md5-demystifying-hash-collisions/) & [Slides](https://2019.pass-the-salt.org/files/slides/01-KILL_MD5.pdf)

When I first saw the name of this conference, I thought it was only about passwords, hashes and crypto (because of the word "SALT").

But it's actually very eclectic with talks on interesting offensive security topics like: reversing Android apps, why MD5 is so weak, JSON Web tokens, Curl, red teaming & open source, Jenkins security, etc.\\
And with brilliant speakers like Orange Tsai and Louis Nyffenegger, I'm sure quality is there too.

### 4. Tool of the week
> [Asset Discover](https://github.com/redhuntlabs/BurpSuite-Asset_Discover) & [Introduction](https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/asset-discovery-burp-extension.html)

Asset Discover is a Burp Suite extension that passively collects asset-related information. While you're browsing the target app, it parses responses and extracts the following assets: domains, subdomains, IP addresses, S3 buckets, DigitalOcean space URLs and Azure Blob URLs.

Having this kind of information passively gathered and easily accessible is interesting. It's worth testing.

### 5. Article of the week
> [Data Breaches are on the Rise — Is it too hard to p̶r̶e̶v̶e̶n̶t̶ control data breaches?](https://medium.com/@ehsahil/data-breaches-are-on-the-rise-is-it-too-hard-to-p%CC%B6r%CC%B6e%CC%B6v%CC%B6e%CC%B6n%CC%B6t%CC%B6-control-data-breaches-c32dc563bb5)

Being obsessed with offensive security, defense is not my forte. But it's interesting to consider both to be able to understand the other side (developers, clients, bug bounty programs...) and, if necessary, advise them on how to remedy bugs or up their security.

This article provides multiple practices that can help avoid breaches, with links to resources (tools, checklists, people to follow, articles, etc).\\
It's good to know for both hackers and defenders.
