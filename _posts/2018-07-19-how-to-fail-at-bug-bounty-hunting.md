twitter-description: Notes taken while watching interesting hacking conferences & videos
---

Hi, these are the notes I took while watching the "How to fail at bug bounty hunting" talk given by [Caleb Kinney](https://hackerone.com/caleb) on LevelUp 2017.

## 7 lessons learned from FAILs
1. **Double-check** that your submission is in **scope**
	- Re-read the BBP brief (contains rules of engagement) AFTER you have written your bug report
2.  **Explain** the vulnerability's **impact** to program owners
	- Include a **PoC**
	- **Prioritize** vulnerabilities

		|---|---|---|
		| P1 | Critical | privilege escalation, sensitive data exfiltration, Remote Code Execution |
		| P2 | Severe | vulns that affect the security of the platform |
		| P3 | Moderate | vulns that affect multiple users and require little or no user interaction | 
		| P4 | Low | vulns that affect single users and require user interaction |
		| P5 | Informational (Won't fix) | no exploitable vulnerabilities and usually will not be fixed by the program |
	
	- **Explain why** the BBP should take action and **remediate** the bug
	- **Explain if** the bug requires victim **interaction**
	- If it does, are you able to bypass any security controls?
	- Explain if the bug **affect single or multiple users**
	- Can you **chain multiple bugs** to **increase their impact**? (Impact is linked to bug rewards and points)
3. **Explain** the bug's **criticality**
	- **Do not submit** bugs **lower that a P3** priority, especially not Won't fix bugs (It affect your average vulnerability severity score. P3 and higher bugs increase your chance of being selected for private programs)
	- Utilize the Bugcrowd [vulnerability rating taxonomy](https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy)
4. **Understand the application**
	- **Research** the app
	- **Ask** questions: [support@bugcrowd.com](mailto:support@bugcrowd.com)
	- **Cross-reference** functions on **mobile and Web** platforms
	- **Ensure, before submitting** your vulnerability, that nothing was overlooked: is your bug a **false positive**? Is it a **known functionality**?
5. **Plan for private programs**
	- **Schedule time** to work on the program as soon as published
6. **Plan for blacklisting**
	- **Segregate** your public **IP** from bug bunty hunting activities
		- Use a VPN or proxy
		- Change your router's MAC address (it forces some ISPs to issue a new public IP address)
7. **Bug bounty is not Penetration testing**
	- Bug bounty programs are interested in **different vulnerabilities**
	- **Different rules**
	- **Different methodology**

## Part-time hunt tips
- Prefer **wide scopes** (\*.example.com)
	- Bonus if Acquisitions/Mergers are in scope
- **Assume automatic scanning** was already **used**
	- Assume low hanging fruit vulnerabilities discoverable with scanners were already found (by the program or other researchers)
- **Recon**, recon, recon: Save time by starting with effective target reconnaissance
	- Subdomain brute forcing
	- port scanning
	- Google dorking
	- [censys.io](https://censys.io)/[shodan.io](https://shodan.io)
- **Think** outside of the box for **new**, emergent and complicated **threat factors**
	- Methods to exploit
	- Emerging threats
	- Vulnerability chaining
	- Use recently discovered vulnerabilities: ImageTragick exploit, blind XSS with XSS hunter
- Use **Burp extensions**
	- [Reflected Parameters](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/8e8f6bb313db46ba9e0a7539d3726651)
	- [BurpKit](https://github.com/allfro/BurpKit)
	- [Co2](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/c5071c7a7e004f72ae485e8a72911afc) (particularly SQLMapper)
- Use **payload lists**
	- Polyglots
- Plug into the Bug Bounty **community**
	- Read
	- Give back
	- Collaborate
- Do **mobile recon**

## Personal mobile recon setup
- **iPhone** with [Blink Shell](http://www.blink.sh/)
	- **Blink Shell** is an ssh & mosh client for iOS that doesn't require JailBreak. It allows roaming and supports intermittent connectivity (perfect for mobiles)
- **RaspberryPi** with DietPi
	- **DietPi** is a lightweight Debian OS for RaspberryPi
- Enable **SSH**
- Install **MOSH** (jump box)
	- MOSH is similar to SSH as a remote terminal application
- Configure **port forwarding** from your public IP to your internal DietPi IP
	- Public TCP port 22 to Private TCP port 22
	- Public UDP port 60000-60010 ro Private UDP port 60000-60010
	- => to be able to access internal machines when outside the house
- Use a **Dynamic DNS** service or domain name to point to your public IP
	- Caleb had a GoDaddy domain and used a script + cron job to interact with GoDaddy's API
- Use the DietPi jumpbox to SSH into boxes on your internal network based on need
- Use **tmux** to multiplex and keep track virtual consoles
- **Kali Linux** on Raspberry Pi / Other machines

## How hunting makes you a better tester
- **Understand** what is **important** to system owners and the industry
- More attuned to **emergent** security **trends**
- **Challenge** myself for more techical exploits
- **Less** dependent on **automation**
- **Find** bugs **faster**
- **Write better** reports
- **Experience** in diverse applications
- Involved in researcher **community**

## Personal recon Script
