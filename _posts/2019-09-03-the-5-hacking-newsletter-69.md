twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 23 to 30 of August.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Non technical item of the week
> [Economics of the bug bounty hunting](https://dmshagov.github.io/Economics-of-the-Bug-Bounty-Hunting/)

This is a great read about how @dmi3sh uses specific metrics to increase his hourly rate as a full-time bug hunter.

The main takeaway for me is that he relies on a list of criteria to decide on which target, functionality and bug type it is best to focus. These are things like: Probability of finding a bug, payout, chance of being duped, of getting N/As and out of scope, chances of being paid, etc.

Using these objective elements helps make decisions about what to focus on a lot easier.

### 2. Tools of the week
> [LinkDumper](https://github.com/arbazkiraak/LinksDumper)\\
> [Jsonp](https://twitter.com/kapytein/status/1165380165469462534)

These are two very handy Burp extensions. I couldn't choose just one as I plan on using both!

LinkDumper extracts links and anything that could be an endpoint from responses. It decodes them, sorts them and displays the findings in a tabs next to the request's "response" tab (anywhere in Burp, like in Target, Proxy History, Repeater...).
What I like about this tool is that it also extracts anything that remotely resembles a link, even "junk". This allows for finding endpoints that could have been missed with a simple regex. I noticed that it can also return URL parameters.

Jsonp is also worth testing. It helps reveal JSONP functionality by probing each JSON endpoint passively detected. When it sees an endpoint responding with `application/json`, it replays the request by appending parameters and/or changing the extension to `.jsonp`.
If a JSONP functionality is found, it could help you bypass CSP or find bugs like XSS and Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI).

### 3. Article of the week
> [Analysis of Common Federated Identity Protocols: OpenID Connect vs OAuth 2.0 vs SAML 2.0](https://blog.hackedu.io/analysis-of-common-federated-identity-protocols/)

This is an excellent introductory article for anyone who struggles with understanding the difference between SSO, OAuth 2, OpenID Connect, and SAML.

You'll find clear and concise definitions, comparison elements, common vulnerabilities, and links for further reading.

### 4. Slides of the week
> [Active Directory security workshop: A red and blue guide to popular AD attacks](https://thevivi.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/theVIVI-AD-Security-Workshop_AfricaHackon2019.pdf) 

This is a 227 pages presentations on Active Directory security. It is full of resources, tools, attacks, techniques and how to protect against them (useful for pentest recommendations).

A great resource for AD security!

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [Bypassing CSRF Protection](https://medium.com/swlh/bypassing-csrf-protection-c9b217175ee)

What do you test for if you see CSRF protection on an app? This tutorial lists several techniques that may gives you new ideas to try.

They are not groundbreaking, but they are basics that every tester should know. The techniques are: Clickjacking, changing the request method, deleting the token parameter or send a blank token, using another session’s CSRF token, session fixation, removing the referrer header, and bypassing the regex.
