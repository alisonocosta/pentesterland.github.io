twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 15 to 22 of February.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Resource of the week
> [NetSPI SQL Injection Wiki](https://sqlwiki.netspi.com/)

This is a great wiki on SQL injection for both beginners and advanced testers.

I'm always talking abount maintaining a personal knowledge base. If you need inspiration, this is a perfect example of one which is very well organized and includes most things you need to learn or remember for testing SQL injections:
- Payloads for detection (by type of request)
- How to identify the Database Management System in use
- The different injection types and techniques including WAF evasion techniques
- Payloads for different attack queries (for information gathering, OS commands execution, privilege escalation, etc)
<!--more-->

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Abusing autoresponders and email bounces](https://medium.com/intigriti/abusing-autoresponders-and-email-bounces-9b1995eb53c2)

I think the best bugs are those found after researching a specific topic, finding a new type of bugs, then applying the finding to as many sites with a bug bounty program as possible.

This is a great strategy for finding a lot of valid bugs but it requires new thinking and discovering something that few people might have noticed. So it is nice to read about @securinti's thought process!

This article encompasses a lot of information like:
- How to find valid target email addresses without spamming them
- Examples of how to exploit them for many different attacks (blind XSS, arbitrary file upload, Ticket Trick, abusing printers...)
- How to abuse autoresponder and bounce emails to obtain sensitive information (like someone's real email address behind a generic one)
- Two examples of such bugs found on Google and Intigriti

Also, don't bother testing for the Intigriti bug on other bug bounty platforms, he already did.

### 3. Tool of the week
> [LazyRecon](https://github.com/capt-meelo/LazyRecon) by @CaptMeelo (not to be confused with @Nahamsec's LazyRecon script)

I love peeping into recon tools and seeing which tools, techniques or development practices they use that I don't.

LazyRecon is very similar to my own automated tool. It's written in Bash, is a wrapper around staple bug hunting tools (like Amass, Subfinder, Massdns, Masscan, Nmap, Aquatone, Dirsearch...) and is organized following a workflow including all the basic recon steps: subdomain enumeration, subdomain takeover, CORS configuration, IP discovery, port scanning, visual recon and content discovery.

I highly recommend reading through the tool's description (especially the "Notes" section) and the source code. It's good to use as is or as a basis for your own complete and customized recon tool.

### 4. Video of the week
> [What is a Security Vulnerability?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=866olNIzbrk)

@LiveOverflow is a genious! Seriously, reading the title of this video, I didn't understand what was there to discuss: a security vulnerability is any unexpected behaviour or flaw which can have a business impact, whether it is financial or brand image loss.
 
But this video is about 5 examples which makes you think:
- A CVE that isn't really a security vulnerability
- A security vulnerability in a smart contract, which isn't one according to the owner of the contract, but is a big issue for investors
- A no-vulnerability that some newbies mistake for one. But if the length of session cookies was shorter, it would actually become a vulnerability...
- Why there are proposals for removing XSS Auditor from browsers, and why an XSS should be reported even if it is stopped by it.
- Whether to report a vulnerability that is not easily exploitable because of TLS

Sometimes, the line is blurry and it takes experience and intuition to decide whether a bug is a vulnerability or not. It makes sense.
I didn't realize this before hearing in it explained in these terms, but I use intuition too. Reading reports and experience that comes from discussions with clients and developers also help.

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [AWS s3 Buckets Create](https://www.mohamedharon.com/2019/02/aws-s3-buckets-create.html)

This is a short to the point tutorial on how to create AWS s3 buckets. It's not groundbreaking but it's nice to have if you find a misconfigured subdomain pointing to an unclaimed bucket name.

Here's an example bug bounty [writeup](https://www.mohamedharon.com/2019/02/subdomain-aws-s3-buckets-reader.html) from the same author on exploiting such a misconfigured subdomain.
