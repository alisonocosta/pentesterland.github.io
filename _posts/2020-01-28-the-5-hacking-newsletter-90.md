twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 17 to 24 of January.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [Frans RosÃ©n Keynote at BSides Ahmedabad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAuuN0OohJc)

This is a talk I've been impatiently waiting for since it was announced. @fransrosen shares his methodology for breaking Web apps/APIs by using fuzzing and information disclosure.

He uses an imaginary app to show practical examples of building custom API wordlists, finding hidden endpoints, etc. An absolute must watch if you've ever come accross tips on Web app fuzzing and did not know how to apply them in practice.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [A Less Known Attack Vector, Second Order IDOR Attacks](https://medium.com/@ozguralp/a-less-known-attack-vector-second-order-idor-attacks-14468009781a)

This writeup shows two instances where an app seemed safe but was actually vulnerable to IDOR. 

In one case, trying to access another account's info returned an error but the information was displayed in a different location.

The second example seems weird. It involves many steps, so I am not going to try to sum it up in a sentence. But it is definitely something I will start testing for. 

### 3. Video of the week
> [@Jhaddix Talks About Defcon, Burp Suite, Hacking, Bug Bounties and How He Does Recon!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MhoDQqcJSc)

This is a cool interview with @Jhaddix. Watch if you want to know how he increased his bug bounty payouts and how he deals with companies that silently fix bugs as soon as they detect that he found them. He transformed an N/A report into a 15K bounty using reporting wizardryðŸ˜±

### 4. Tools of the week
> - [Sourcemapper](https://github.com/tehryanx/sourcemapper)
> - [Recon-pipeline](https://github.com/epi052/recon-pipeline) & [How to Build an Automated Recon Pipeline with Python and Luigi - Part VI (Wrapping Up)](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2020-01-19-how-to-build-an-automated-recon-pipeline-with-python-and-luigi-part-six/)

Sourcemapper is a Bash script that reconstructs JavaScript from a sourcemap. It is a reliable and fast way to retrieve JS files for further analysis (using tools like LinkFinder).

The recon pipeline is an awesome example of recon automation using Python. The tutorials are fantastic for anyone who want not only a recon tool, but mostly how to build your own.

### 5. Resources of the week
> - [Bug Bounty Checklist for Web App](https://github.com/sehno/Bug-bounty/blob/master/bugbounty_checklist.md)
> - [Rewrote my recon bot to output to markdown and upload to a git server](https://twitter.com/the_hacker_lab/status/1218685261686681602)

These are cool examples of leveraging markdown to save recon results in a Git repository and to create a testing checklist (in any Markdown note-taking app like Joplin).

It seems so obvious now but when I started using Markdown, I did not think that it could help with these two situations.
In both cases, markdown allows you to take notes that are easy to backup and are displayed in a human-friendly format.
