Hi, this is the second edition of The 5 Hacking NewsLetter. It's a few days late but better late than never, right?\\
Grab a nice cup of coffe (or herbal tea if you're an old soul like me) and enjoy!

Also, don't forget to [subscribe]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/subscribe.html) if you prefer receiving this on your inbox.

## 1. Tool of the week
> [CTFR](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr) by [Sheila A. Berta](https://twitter.com/unapibageek?lang=en)

This is a great tool that I've just added to my testing arsenal. It gets subdomains of an HTTPS website in a few seconds by abusing [certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) [transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) logs.

For quick reference, here's how to install and use it:
```console
git clone https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr.git
cd ctfr/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ctfr.py -h		# Show help
python ctfr.py -d example.com	# Get subdomains of HTTPS website
```

## 2. Tweet of the week
> [<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletters/T5HN2_tweet.png" alt="T5HN2_tweet.png" >](https://twitter.com/hizeena/status/971788877596889088?s=19)

This is one of the best definitions of hacking I've ever heard! It rings especially true on days I am doing pentest challenges (when I known for a fact that there is a vulnerability but can't find it for hours).

## 3. Webcast that taught me a lot of testing tips
> [SANS Webcast: OSINT for Pentesters Finding Targets and Enumerating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHOMGUTi9yo&feature=youtu.be)

I think this webcast could be very helpful if you're a pentester or bug bounty hunter. It offers many tips, some of which I haven't been using and will help improve my recon process.

## 4. Bug bounty write-up of the week
> [Stored XSS, and SSRF in Google using the Dataset Publishing Language](https://s1gnalcha0s.github.io/dspl/2018/03/07/Stored-XSS-and-SSRF-Google.html) by Craig Arendt

$18,337 for a stored XSS and a SSRF on Google! I love this insight on where and what to test in order to find such vulnerabilities on highly tested targets like Google.

My takeaways:
- The XSS payload is JavaScript put inside an XML CDATA section injected in an XML tag. The CDATA section prevents the JavaScript from being executed as XML.
- The Dataset Publishing Language tool generates a zip file. It was downloaded, unzipped, modified to add the payload, then zipped again and uploaded.

## 5. Another web app security podcast & Youtube channel I like
> Absolute AppSec [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9CDrIB0rJwG4GGz8CZEaQ) & [podcast](https://absoluteappsec.com/)

Although started recently, this podcast / Youtube channel looks very promising. They tackle different security topics with a focus on Web app security.
